     "SITE_HISTORY": "Case closure for this fuel leak site is granted for the current commercial land use as a gasoline station and the existing building only.  If a change in land use to any other commercial, residential or other conservative land use scenario occurs at this site; Alameda County Environmental Health (ACEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  A soil vapor survey has not been conducted as part of this investigation.  Redevelopment in proximity to the UST system will require evaluation of soil vapor, at a minimum.  ACEH must also be notified if any construction or excavation activities take place or the building structure is otherwise modified. ACEH will re-evaluate the case upon receipt of approved development\/construction plans.    This closure applies only to the former UST fuel systems circa 1984.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party (or current property owner\/developer) prior to and during excavation and construction activities.  The site is currently an operating Valero gasoline station which was previously operated as Exxon Service Station #7-0104.  The surrounding area is mixed commercial and residential use.    In 1986, four gasoline USTs (2-5,000 gallon, 1-8,000-gallon and 1- 10,000 gallon) were removed and replaced with three 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs.  No reports are available for the tank removal.    In June 1988, HLA performed a Phase II evaluation of petroleum hydrocarbons at the site, which included the installation of three groundwater monitoring wells (MW1 through MW3) and initiation of quarterly monitoring and sampling activities. Maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene were reported at 1,400 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) and 0.0670 mg\/kg, respectively, in the soil samples collected from boring MW2 at 5 feet below ground surface (bgs) and boring MW1 at 10 feet bgs, respectively.    In January 1989, HLA oversaw the collection of six Hydropunch™ grab groundwater samples and the installation of monitoring wells MW4 through MW6.  Maximum concentrations of dissolved-phase TPHg and benzene were reported at 76,000 micrograms per liter (µg\/L) and 16,000 µg\/L, respectively at sample P-5.  Maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene in soil were reported at 490 mg\/kg and 3.7 mg\/kg, respectively, in boring MW6.    From January through March 1990, HLA advanced borings SB-1 through SB-7 and installed well MW-7.  Maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene were reported in boring SB1 at 5 feet bgs at 2,600 mg\/kg and 6.9 mg\/kg, respectively.      In 1991, HLA evaluated groundwater samples for bioremediation and oversaw the installation of five extraction wells   (EW1 through EW5).     In September 1992, HLA oversaw the collection of 21 Hydropunch™ grab groundwater samples along Park Street and Eagle Avenue.  The samples were advanced to a depth of approximately 12 feet bgs. Maximum concentrations of dissolved-phase TPHg, TPHd, and benzene were reported at 220,000 µg\/L, 1,500 ppb, and 11,000 µg\/L, respectively in sample P-3.      In September 1992, HLA performed a vapor-extraction test.    In December 1992, HLA began construction of a groundwater pump and treat system (GWPTS).  In February 1993, HLA began operation of the GWPTS.    On May 5, 1993, RESNA oversaw the installation of monitoring wells MW8 through MW10.  Concentrations of TPHg and benzene were below laboratory reporting limits in the three borings.    On November 1, 1993, RESNA oversaw the installation of wells VM1, VW1, SM1, and SW1 and air sparge and vapor extraction testing.  Maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene were reported at 1,800 mg\/kg and 7.6 mg\/kg, respectively, in the sample collected at 7 feet bgs from boring SM1.  Air sparge and vapor extraction were deemed feasible for the site.    In August 1995, Delta Environmental Consultants Inc. (Delta) oversaw installation of monitoring wells MW11 and MW12.    In June 1997, Delta oversaw soil sampling during removal and upgrade of dispensers and product lines.  Maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene were reported at 1,200 mg\/kg and 3.2 mg\/kg, respectively, from sample PL2 at a depth of 3.5 feet bgs.  Pea gravel removed from within the product lines and the area above the USTs was used as backfill following the upgrade activities.    In February 1998, operation of an air sparge\/soil vapor extraction (AS\/SVE) system was initiated at the site.  The system ran from 1998 to 2000.  The system was retrofitted and again operated from June 2000 to February 2004.  Approximately 1,746.96 pounds of TPHg and 27.72 pounds of benzene were removed by the AS\/SVE system during its periods of operation.    In 2005, ERI retrofitted the GWPTS and AS\/SVE systems.  ERI modified the SVE system to use an 8.45-horsepower regenerative blower (Siemens 2BH1 800-7A) capable of producing 360 scfm.  ERI also modified groundwater extraction wells EW1 through EW5 to simultaneously extract soil vapor and pump and treat groundwater.  Other components and processes of the systems remained unchanged.  The retrofitted systems began operation on June 27, 2005 and ran until December 2010.      In February 2012, Cardno ERI advanced on-site confirmation soil borings SB16 through SB21 to approximately 5.5 feet bgs using hand-auger equipment for the collection of soil samples.  Maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene were reported at 4,100 mg\/kg and 2.7 mg\/kg, respectively, in the sample collected from boring SB20; however, the hydrocarbon pattern for TPHg did not resemble the pattern of TPHg.    In March 2012, Cardno ERI advanced off-site confirmation soil borings SB14 and SB15 for the collection of soil and groundwater samples.  Residual hydrocarbon concentrations were below laboratory reporting limits in both samples.  Maximum concentrations of dissolved-phase TPHg and MTBE were reported at 1,500 µg\/L (SB14) and 3.4 µg\/L (SB15), respectively.  Dissolved-phase benzene concentrations were below laboratory reporting limits.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    In late October or early November 2009 one gasoline UST was converted to a diesel UST.  Subsequently in July 2011 free-phase product, later fingerprinted as diesel product, was detected in well RW-1.  These data indicate than an unauthorized release had occurred.    This case was formerly regulated under Case No. RO0003140 but has been assigned a new case number per the direction of the USTCF in December 2016 to separate the diesel release (associated with the gasoline tank conversion in 2009) from a waste oil release in the southeastern corner of the site (RO No. RO0003140).  There are two other cases associated with this site. Former Case No. RO0000281 (gasoline only release - closed) and open Case No. RO0003140 (waste oil release) in southeastern corner of site.    At the time of case closure, the site is a 7,000-square-foot parcel located on the southeastern corner of the intersection of Webster Street and Buena Vista Avenue in the City and County of Alameda, California.  The site is developed with a single-story commercial building occupied by a Circle-K convenience store, and an operating 76 gasoline service station, a concrete paved parking area, and minor landscaping along the eastern side and northwest corner of the parcel.  Adjacent to the property on the east side are residences, across Buena Vista Avenue to the north is an operating Chevron gas station and commercial properties are located south and west of the site.  According to the Assessor’s Office Property Value System and Sanborne Maps, this site has historically been used as a commercial fueling station since at least 1948.    The case was opened in March 2017 to evaluate potential impacts to human health and the environment from unauthorized releases of petroleum hydrocarbons and related fuel constituents from a 6,000 gallon diesel UST.  The release was originally discovered in July 2011, when free-phase product was discovered in well RW-1, located adjacent to the converted diesel tank.  Fingerprint analysis later identified the free product as diesel fuel.  This investigation was originally a part of LUST case RO0003140 which subsequently bifurcated to investigate the waste oil and diesel releases separately.  The investigation for LUST case RO0003235 was opened to evaluate the diesel fuel release in the northwest corner of the site associated with the conversion of the UST to a diesel UST.    Field work was conducted in 2018 to delineate the diesel groundwater plume in the northwestern corner of the site.  Four cone penetrometer testing (CPT) bores were located in the public right-of-way on Webster Street and Buena Vista Avenue, and a fifth CPT bore was drilled in the northeastern corner of the site.  The CPT bores collected lithologic data, soil, and grab groundwater samples to determine the extent of diesel contamination at the site.    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP).  The site meets all eight General Critiera, the Groundwater  Media-Specific Criteria, is exempt from the Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air Criteria onsite becauase it is an active service station, but the eastern margin of the property was also evaluated against the Residential Scenario in the Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air Criteria due to the presence of a residential house and neighborhood to the east, and meets the Residential Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air Media Specific Criteria on the eastern property margin of the subject site.  The site also meets the Commercial and Industrial Direct Contact Media-Specific Criteria.    While not a part of this environmental case, the site does not meet the Residential Direct Contact Media-Specific Crieria due to non-detectable PAHs above residential PAH Direct Contact values.  Under the current land use, except for limited areas along the eastern property margin and several additional minor landscaped areas, the site is entirely paved resulting in a low potential for direct contact exposure under the current land use as a city street.  Due to residual contamination at the site associated with the diesel UST, the site is closed as a commercial service station site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party, prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    Based on the information in the case file, and with the provision that the information provided to ACDEH is accurate and representative of site conditions, this case has been closed.  A 60-day public notification period was completed on 4\/5\/2019.",

In 1988 and 1989, Kaprealian Engineering installed six GW monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-6) at the site.  In 1992, a groundwater extraction system including recovery well RW-1 began operating at the site.  In 1995, the treatment system operation ceased and ORC socks were installed.  Groundwater monitoring was conducted from October 1988 until October 2001 when it was discontinued pending review of a case closure request. Four subsequent events were conducted in October 2006, June 2009, March 2010 and July 2010. Verification soil sampling was conducted in September 2009 and then again in October 2010 to assess soil conditions in the area of historic sidewall sample locations C-1 and W.O.-1 obtained during the UST removals in 1987. The site is currently in the process of being closed under the Low Threat Closure Policy.     The site is currently an active 76-brand retail gasoline service station. Properties surrounding the site are primarily commerical and retail.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently developed as a mixed-use commercial\/residential development and is located at the corner of Blanding Avenue and Everett Street in Alameda, California.  Surrounding property use is mixed commercial and residential.  The site was reportedly operated as a light manufacturing plant until 1998 and was then remodeled to its current use.     September 12, 2002 - UST removal and Overexcavation #1 - a 300 gallon gasoline underground storage tank (UST) was removed from beneath the sidewalk along Everett Street.  Approximately 50 gallons of residual leaded gasoline and tank rinsate liquid was removed from the tank prior to extraction.  There were no visible holes in the tank, but odor and visual evidence of contamination was noted in the stockpiled overburden soil and soil beneath the tank.  The tank pit was overexcavated to 8 feet bgs to remove contaminated soil, which was added to the stockpile.  After completion of the first overexcavation, one soil sample was collected at 8 feet bgs from beneath the former tank and detected 0.579 parts per million (ppm) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg).  Additionally, one four-point composite sample was collected from stockpiled soil and contained 50.1 ppm TPHg and 22.9 ppm lead.  Fuel oxygenates were not detected.  No groundwater was encountered during the September 12, 2002 over-excavation activities.  Upon completion of the confirmation sampling, the tank pit was lined with plastic, the overburden stockpile and additional clean soil was used to backfill the tank pit, and the area was repaved. Approximately 9.3 tons of contaminated overexcavated soil was disposed of as non-hazardous waste at a landfill.      November 27, 2002 - Overexcavation #2 - The former UST pit was re-excavated and one soil and one grab groundwater sample were collected at 4.5 feet bgs.  Analysis of the soil sample from the north sidewall of the re-excavation just above the groundwater interface detected up to 1,450 ppm TPHg.  Analyzed grab groundwater from the excavation detected 890 parts per billion (ppb) TPHg.  Fuel oxygenates were not detected in the soil or groundwater samples.  The groundwater interface was observed at approximately 4.5 feet bgs.  The excavation was left open, covered with plywood, and fenced off pending receipt of sample results.    January 3, 2003 - Overexcavation #3 – Additional excavation of contaminated soil was performed and two soil samples and one groundwater sample were collected.  Analysis of one soil sample collected from the east sidewall of the excavation at six feet below ground surface (feet bgs) detected 9.16 ppm TPHg and 105 ppm Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd).  The second soil sample was collected at ten feet bgs from the north wall and petroleum hydrocarbons were not detected.  Up to 8,910 ppb TPHg and 22,200 ppb TPHd were detected in an excavation grab groundwater sample.  The second and third overexcavation events generated an additional 10.01 tons of soil which was disposed off off-site as non-hazardous waste at a landfill.    Five soil borings (B-1 through B-5) were installed in November 2006.  The borings were placed on three sides of the former UST pit excavation and were 10 feet to 50 feet away from the tank excavation.  Soil samples collected from each boring at approximately four feet bgs at the groundwater interface detected up to 12 ppm TPHd, 0.0075 ppm tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA), and 2.46 ppm lead.   Groundwater samples were collected between four and fifteen feet bgs. Up to 8,500 ppb TPHD was detected in a grab groundwater sample from boring B-4, which is located approximately ten feet southwest of the former UST; TPHg or BTEX were not detected in any of the groundwater samples.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In January 1990, six borings were installed at the site in the area of the former tank complex prior to removal and replacement of five USTs (one 10,000 gallon, two 4,000 gal, and two 6,000 gallon).  Elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil samples collected during the investigation.  In July and September 1990, the USTs were removed with elevated petroleum hydrocarbons detected in UST compliance soil samples.  A total of 1,950 cubic yards of soil was disposed of off-site. In September 1990, four on-site wells (A-1 through A-4), one recovery well (AR-1), and three vapor extraction wells (AV-4 through AV-7) were installed to determine magnitude and extent of groundwater contamination.  In June 1992, one down-gradient off-site well (A-5) and one on-site recovery well (AR-2) were installed to evaluate the vertical and horizontal extent of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination and provide extraction wells for use with interim soil vapor and groundwater remediation systems. In October 1992, a vapor extraction pilot test was conducted. During the fourth quarter of 1992, a soil vapor extraction (SVE)and groundwater extraction treatment system (GWET) was installed.The GWET and SVE system operated from January 1993 until August 1995 due to low influent concentrations. The systems were decommissioned and removed from the site in 1997 and groundwater monitoring discontinued. Site wells were redeveloped in 2006 and groundwater monitoring was conducted in 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2013.    The site was evaluated for case closure under the State Water Resources Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy and was closed on August 20, 2014.  Based upon the information available in our files to date, no further investigation or cleanup for the fuel leak case is necessary at this time.      Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm.",

This case did not evaluate historic use of other areas of the site nor the historic use of the site as a shipyard and World War II ship repair facility.      Two separate fuel leak cases (RO0000848 and RO0002951) address fuel leaks from UST systems in other areas of the site.  Fuel leak case RO0000848 addressed leaks from former gasoline and diesel fuel USTs that were removed in July 1999.  Case closure for fuel leak case RO0000848 was documented in Remedial Action Certification correspondence from ACEH dated October 5, 1999.  Fuel leak case RO0002951 addressed leaks from two former Bunker oil USTs and a diesel UST that were removed in march 2007.  Case closure for fuel leak case RO0002951 was documented in Remedial Action Certification correspondence from ACEH dated March 1, 2010.      Since 1990, the building at 1829 Clement Avenue has been used as commercial office space.  Surrounding land use is mixed commercial and residential; the area north of Clement Avenue has industrial and commercial properties and the area south of Clement Avenue has mixed commercial and residential properties.  From 1967 to 1986, the building at 1829 Clement Avenue was used as a photochemical machining shop.  From 1986 until March 1990, Kem Mil performed photodeveloping and etching inside the building at 1829 Clement Avenue.  Inspections by ACEH in 1990 found spills from drums and small tanks both on and through the subfloor of the building.  Spills and discharges of liquids containing heavy metals as well as acids and bases to the subfloor and sewer were documented.  The primary areas of contamination were the subfloor areas of the etch process room in the western end of the building and the treatment and storage areas in the eastern end of the building.  Soil samples collected by Kem Mill from the subfloor on September 9, 1988 detected arsenic at 120 ppm, chromium at 1,000 ppm, copper at 6,400 ppm, molybdenum at 1,800 ppm, lead at 28 ppm, and zinc at 680 ppm.    On September 16, 1988, Blymyer Engineers collected three surface soil samples from portions of the building underlain by a dirt subfloor and one soil sample from a depth of 4 feet bgs beneath surface soil sample 002501.  The soil samples contained elevated concentrations of heavy metals, cyanide, and other compounds.   Based on these initial results, an additional field investigation consisting of 13 soil borings and 7 surface soil samples was conducted between February 11 and March 9, 1990 by Kaldveer Associates.  Surface soil samples collected beneath the western portion of the building contained cyanide at concentrations ranging from 120 to 1,300 ppm.  Soil samples collected at a depth of 0.5 feet in this area contained 2.1 to 7.8 ppm of cyanide.   Soil samples collected from depths of 3.0 and 6.0 feet bgs contained less than 2 ppm of cyanide.  One sample of dried sediment collected from the surface of the asphalt paving beneath the eastern portion of the building contained 1,100 ppm of cyanide, 800 ppm of chromium, and 2,900 ppm of copper.  Soil samples collected from a depth of 0.5 feet below the asphalt beneath the treatment room contained 7.1 to 160 ppm of cyanide and soil samples collected from the 3.0 and 6.0 feet depth contained 1.5 to 24 ppm of cyanide.     The results of the 1988 and 1990 investigations indicated that significant quantities of cyanide and metals were generally within the upper 3 to 6 inches of soil beneath the former etch process area in the western portion of the building and in the dried sediment on top of asphalt paving located beneath the treatment area in the eastern portion of the building.      A clean-up program consisting of high-efficiency vacuuming of the asphalt pavement beneath the eastern portion of the building (treatment and storage areas) and hand removal of surface soils beneath the western portion of thebuilding (etch process areas) was conducted between April 16 and May 24, 1990.  Following the vacuuming beneath the eastern portion of the building, the pavement surface and concrete footings were sealed with three inches of cement slurry and stucco.      Following soil removal beneath the western portion of the building, concrete footings were sealed with latex enamel paint.  In addition to removal of the contaminated soil, all former process piping and stained wood flooring were removed from the building.  Laboratory analysis of nine surficial soil samples collected following clean-up reported cyanide concentrations ranging from less than 1.0 to 8.3 ppm.  Residual concentrations of copper ranged from 5.6 to 360 ppm.  Visual observation of staining and soil discoloration was used to guide clean-up and sampling activities.      Based on all post-cleanup soil sample results, cyanide exceeds the Environmental Screening Level (ESL) for residential land use and direct exposure to shallow soil of 34 ppm at two locations:  sample 2502 (2,300 ppm) collected at a depth of four feet bgs beneath the west portion of the building and composite sample B1&amp;B2 (160 ppm) collected at a depth of 0.5 feet bgs underneath the eastern portion of the building.   Sample 2502, which was collected by Blymyer Engineers on September 15, 1988, is the only post-cleanup sample that had cyanide concentrations exceeding the ESL beneath the western portion of the building.  A total of 18 post-cleanup soil samples collected in the surrounding area had cyanide concentrations below the ESL.  The laboratory analytical report for sample 2502 indicates laboratory interference for this sample, which potentially may affect the reported concentration.  Given the apparent limited extent of the soil represented by sample 2502, the depth of the sample, and likely effects of cyanide degradation over the extended period of time since sampling, further investigation or remediation beneath the western portion of the building does not appear to be warranted.  Free cyanide in soil can be expected to undergo degradation, dissolution, and volatilization, which reduces the cyanide concentrations over time.  Composite sample B1&amp;B2 was the only post-cleanup soil sample with total cyanide concentrations exceeding the ESL beneath the eastern portion of the building.  Based on the apparent limited extent of the area and the period of time that has passed since the sample was collected, further investigation or remediation beneath the eastern portion of the building does not appear to be warranted.    Arsenic was detected in post-cleanup soil samples at concentrations exceeding the ESL (0.39 ppm) in three soil samples collected beneath the eastern portion of the building and six soil samples collected beneath the western portion of the building.  However, the reported concentrations of arsenic in the post-cleanup soil samples are below typical ambient concentrations.     Three groundwater monitoring wells were installed at the site on September 11, 1990.  The wells were completed to 15 feet bgs.  Groundwater samples were collected from the wells during three events in 1990:  September 12, 1990, September 25, 19990, and October 9, 1990.  Groundwater samples were analyzed for chromium, molybdenum, copper, lead, chromium VI, arsenic, and cyanide.  During the three sampling events in 1990, total cyanide was detected in monitoring well MW-1 at concentrations ranging from 350 to 2,400 ppb but was not detected at concentrations above reporting limits in groundwater samples from wells MW-2 and MW-3.    Following, re-development, groundwater samples were collected from the three wells on March 16, 2007.  Cyanide was detected in groundwater from well MW-1 at a concentration of 16 ppb but was not detected in groundwater samples from the remaining two wells.    In order to assess potential vapor intrusion to indoor air by volatile organic compounds, soil vapor sampling was conducted in September 2010.  Soil vapor samples were collected from four locations beneath the building on September 22, 2010.  No volatile organic compounds were detected at concentrations exceeding ESLs for potential vapor intrusion under residential or commercial\/industrial land use scenarios.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Current Land-use at time of Closure  The site consists of two residential properties located at 1315 and 1317 Court Street, Alameda, California.  The two involved parcels included a partial cinder block wall, at the rear of the two parcels, and approximately on the property line between two parcels.    Adjacent Property(ies) Land-use at Time of Closure  Field screening, and subsequent analytical testing occurred at 1315 and 1317 Court Street, and at 2908 Jackson Street.    Mercury concentrations above Levels of Concern were not identified at the 2908 Jackson Street property.    Historic Land-use \/ Site Investigation  1315 and 1317 Court Street were residential properties at the time of release identification.  Elemental mercury was discovered in the backyard of the residence at 1315 Court Street.  An interim removal was conducted at the 1315 Court Street address by a Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) emergency response contractor.  Additional investigations were subsequently conducted at the intersection of the parcels associated with 1315 and 1317 Court, and 2908 Jackson Streets.  The initial investigation used a high vacuum mercury pump and grid sampling to isolate elevated mercury vapor concentrations and soil samples were subsequently collected at locations with elevated responses.  Further soil sampling isolated the source, and areas with elevated mercury concentrations in soil.  The source appears to have been a small clay pot located at the residential property at 1317 Court Street that migrated to 1315 Court Street.  Several excavations were successfully undertaken on the two adjacent properties to reduce mercury concentrations to below residential Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) as promulgated by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB).  The area was backfilled with commercial organic rich landscaping soil that also yielded a low mercury concentration.    Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern  Elemental mercury and residual mercury soil contamination is the chemical of concern at the site.  Mercury has a potential direct contact exposure route.  At the volume observed at the site, it is not anticipated to have contaminated groundwater.  A vapor ESL has not been issued by the RWQCB.    Remediation Activities  Several excavations were successfully undertaken on the two adjacent properties to reduce mercury concentrations to below residential ESLs.  The area was backfilled with commercial organic rich landscaping soil that yielded a low mercury concentration.    Case Closure &amp; Future Site Management Requirements  This mercury release case has been evaluated for closure using the RWQCB ESLs.  No Site Management Requirements appear required.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently an auto body repair shop. A 500-gallon waste-oil UST and a one 2,000-gallon gasoline USTs were removed from the site on August 31, 2015. Groundwater was encountered at 7’4” below grade in the gasoline UST excavation; consequently, a soil sample was not collected from beneath the gasoline UST but a water sample detected 51.2 parts per billion (ppb) benzene and 738 ppb Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as Gasoline (TPHg). These data indicate that an unauthorized release from the USTs has occurred at the site and this Leaking Underground Fuel Tank (LUFT) case was opened to investigate the release.    During the UST removal, the soil removed during the UST removal was used without authorization from ACDEH CUPA.  An environmental investigation conducted in 2016  included the collection of soil and grab groundwater samples. There are no known plans to redevelop the site.    This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH determined that the site met all the LTCP General Criteria and the Media Specific Criteria for Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air, and Media Specific Criteria for Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Exposure.  The site does not meet the Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater because ACPWA records indicate the presence of an irrigation well at 1819 Everett Street, located directly across the street from the site and within 250 feet of the site.  Although the site does not meet the distance criteria of 250 feet to the nearest supply well, ACDEH has determined that the length of the plume is less than the distance to 1819 Everett Street, the nearest supply well’s associated property address. Therefore, the site poses a low risk to human health and safety and the environment. The determination was based on receptors and environmental conditions identified at and in the vicinity of the site at the time of closure and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios.",

Previous activities and investigations at UST 163 (associated with operations conducted at Building 163; the tank had a nominal storage capacity of 2000 gallons and stored either fuel oil or waste oil) include the following:   In 1995, UST 163 was removed and approximately 250 cubic feet of soil along the eastern sidewall of the UST pit were over-excavated because of elevated concentrations of TRPH in a soil sample (Battelle, 2012). Additionally, a groundwater sample was retrieved from the excavation.   In 2009, two borings were advanced in the area north of former UST 163 to collect groundwater samples (Battelle, 2012).    The soil and groundwater analytical data collected at the time of UST removal in 1995 indicated that a localized fuel oil release had likely occurred; soil with elevated TRPH concentrations (1,100 milligrams per kilogram [mg\/kg]) was excavated and removed at that time (Battelle, 2012). Concentrations of lead (120 micrograms per liter [µg\/L]), TPH as diesel (220 µg\/L), and TPH as motor oil (900 µg\/L) were detected in the groundwater sample collected from the excavation.    Groundwater sampling activities were conducted in 2009. The 2009 site investigation included collection of two groundwater samples north of the former UST at borings 163-GW-01 and 163-GW-02. Maximum concentrations of TPH as diesel and TPH as motor oil were detected at 570 µg\/L and 1,400 µg\/L, respectively, confirming that a fuel release had likely occurred.     To complete the characterization and delineation of petroleum hydrocarbon impacts on  the site, the following activities were conducted from June 2017 to January 2018:  1. Three groundwater monitoring wells were installed and two soil samples per boring were collected and analyzed for lead and TPH extractables and purgeables.   2. The three groundwater monitoring wells were monitored in two semiannual events to analyze for lead and TPH purgeables and extractables.    The CAA 4A Remedial Design specifies excavation of contaminated soil from the vadose zone and use of ISCO technology for groundwater. The ISCO compound introduces an oxidizing  agent into the groundwater to deteriorate target contaminants, such as petroleum hydrocarbons, into less harmful compounds.",

On February 5, 2009, during a fuel delivery to the City of Alameda Maintenance Services facility, the diesel UST was overfilled, diesel fuel entered the fuel vent line, and was released onto the surface.  On March 10, 2009 the City of Alameda completed an Unauthorized Release Form (URF), but no soil or groundwater samples were collected to determine the extent of the release.    Two investigations were conducted to determine the extent of the diesel release into the subsurface.  Soil and groundwater samples collected to determine the extent of contamination indicated that there are residual concentrations of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in site soil between depths of 0 to 5 feet.  A grab groundwater sample detected methyl tert butyl ether (MTBE) at a concentration of 12 micrograms per liter but no TPHd, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, or xylenes (BTEX)  or PAHs.  As a City of Alameda Maintenance Services facility is entirely paved and exposure to site soils is limited, except in controlled conditions under the current commercial land use.

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Site History: This site is a former commercial petroleum fueling facility that was demolished in 1986.  Throughout the operation period (from at least 1930), the station had several different configurations with prior generations of USTs and system components.  An unauthorized release was reported during station demolition in 1986 following the removal of five USTs (two waste oil and three gasoline), two dispenser islands and related piping during station demolition. A single family home was constructed on the site in 1989, consisting of a 2-story residence with living areas constructed above a crawl space and an attached garage with slab-on-grade construction.  over the former location of the fuel tanks.     Environmental Investigations: Environmental investigations began in August 1986 after the service station was demolished and have been ongoing to present. Results of environmental investigations indicate that soil, groundwater and soil vapor have elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbon constituents at levels above risk based screening levels. Constituents of concern (COC) include total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, total xylenes (collectively know as BTEX).      Groundwater: A total of ten groundwater monitoring wells (C-1 to C-3, MW-4 to MW-10)  have been installed at the site and regularly monitored.  The current groundwater monitoring well network consists of 9 wells (C-2 was apparently destroyed during construction of the residence in 1989). Results of the investigations indicate that groundwater beneath the site is shallow with seasonal fluctuation depths ranging from between approximately 0 to 6 feet below ground surface (bgs) across the site. Free product has historically been detected in wells C-1 (located 20 feet from foundation) at thicknesses up to 2.2 feet, and currently  consistently contains thin but measurable free-phase product.  No measurable LNAPL has been observed in C-1 during recent monitoring events, however absorbent socks installed in the well to remove free product indicate the presence of free product upon removal. Subslab vapor concentrations beneath the garage foundation indicate light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) is present beneath the garage foundations. Elevated groundwater concentrations are found offsite downgradient; the groundwater plume appears defined further downgradient.     Soil: Several rounds of soil bore installation also occurred in that period of time. Onsite soil bores B-1 to B-8 were installed in January 2018, and bores B-9 to B-14 were installed in October 2015.     Soil Vapor and Indoor Air:  A vapor intrusion assessment was conducted in 2018 and included collection of subslab, crawl space, indoor air, and outdoor air samples, and an evaluation of the construction of the residential structure to further evaluate potential vapor intrusion concerns to the onsite residence from petroleum hydrocarbons in the subsurface. Results of subslab vapor samples collected beneath the concrete foundation of the garage indicate a potential vapor intrusion risk due to elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons including but not limited to TPHg and benzene. Petroleum hydrocarbons were also detected in indoor air in the garage and residence, however, the evaluation concluded that the petroleum hydrocarbons were due to sources present in the garage and subsequent migration into the residence via the interior garage door.    Remedial Actions. Remedial actions formerly implemented at the site include a aeration of soil excavated from the UST pit (reused as backfill), groundwater pump and treat system using a recovery trench and extraction well RW-1 (still present onsite), oxygen release compound injections in wells MW-6 and MW-7 and hydrogen peroxide injections in well C-1, groundwater batch extraction events, hand bailing and installation of a skimmer and absorbent socks in well C-1 to remove impacted groundwater and free product. Additional corrective actions are warranted and are presented in a Corrective Action Plan, dated August 19, 2019 and proposed installation of vapor mitigation measures including application of Retro-Coat to the top of the concrete slab in the garage to create a vapor-tight covering to inhibit potential future migration of vapors into the building, and injection of a surfactant into the LNAPL zone to increase LNAPL solubility and mobility using two new remediation wells (installed adjacent to the garage to address mass beneath the garage)and groundwater monitoring well C-1, and multi-phase extraction of groundwater and soil vapor to extract the dissolved phase constituents and mobilized LNAPL from the remediation wells and well C-1.  ACDEH has conditionally approved the proposed alternative however has requested submittal of a Corrective Action Implementation Plan (CAIP) providing detailed designs of the  proposed corrective actions prior to implementation.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently vacant land with proposed redevelopment consisting of first-floor commercial and residential\/office suites above.  In June 1998, two 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs and one 550-gallon waste-oil tank were removed.  Two holes were observed near the fill pipe in the waste-oil tank. Approximately 338 tons of soil\/ tank pit backfill were excavated and disposed off site as part of the tank removals.   Preliminary investigations began in March 1999 after receipt of the tank soil and water results.  Four on-site monitoring wells were installed at that time. Subsequently,  a total of ten on- and off site wells have been installed.    In December 2002, an additional 292 tons of hydrocarbon-impacted soil was excavated from beneath the former eastern dispenser island.      In August 2008, one CPT was advanced to a maximum depth of 55 feet to vertically define groundwater contamination with discrete groundwater samples recovered at depths of 25, 35, 45, and 55 feet.  MTBE  was reported at concentrations of 21,000 ug\/L , 260 ug\/L, 1.0 ug\/L, and &lt;1.0 ug\/L, respectively, indicating deeper zones of MTBE contamination were present which are not monitored by the shallow zone monitoring well network.   The shallow groundwater plume appears to be defined by the network of wells screened in the 5- to 20- foot zone; however, the plume in the deeper zone(s) was not defined by the one well screened in the 20 to 25- foot zone and four wells in the 25- to 30-foot zone.      A pilot test was performed in 2008 to test ozone sparging to remediate MTBE that was discovered at depth beneath the site, and in August-September, 2009, an ozone injection pilot test was performed.      The plume appears to have commingled with contaminants from the nearby up gradient Shell Station site.  Shell and Chevron performed a joint investigation to delineate leading edge of MTBE plume.  Seven CPTs were advanced for the recovery of depth discrete grab groundwater samples from the intervals of 25-29', 30-34', 35-39', and 40-44' bgs.  CPTs 2, 3 , 4, 6 and 7, as reported in the 12\/29\/2014 groundwater investigation, appears to have delineated the vertical and horizontal leading edge of the plume, addressing the last remaining data gap.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Three single wall fiberglass gasoline USTs (12,000 gallon, 10,000 gallon, 6,000 gallon), one waste oil UST (unknown capacity), and single wall fiberglass product piping were installed at the site in 1983. In 1987, the waste oil tank UST was replaced by Mobil Oil Corporation with a 1,000 gallon capacity double wall fiberglass UST (there is no further documentation regarding the tank replacement or an unauthorized release).    In September 1990, BP Oil Company retained Kaprealian Engineering, Inc. (KEI) to collect soil samples from beneath the pump islands and the product piping for the three USTs containing super unleaded, regular unleaded, and regular leaded gasoline during a routine dispenser modification. The analytical results indicated an unauthorized release of petroleum hydrocarbons had occurred. Additional soil excavation of hydrocarbon impacted soil was conducted in the vicinity of the dispenser islands to a depth of 9 feet, and 1,000 gallons of impacted groundwater pumped from the excavated area before backfilling with clean material; however, the extent of the impacted soil was not completely delineated by the additional excavation and soil sampling. Soil and groundwater samples were analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and total xylenes (BTEX), and total lead. Up to 7,500 ppm of TPHg was detected in soil samples and 38,000 ppb of TPHg and 4,900 ppb of benzene in water samples collected from the excavation.    In July 1992, BP retained Hydro-Environmental Technologies, Inc (HETI) to continue the environmental investigation at the site including installation of three onsite groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-3) near potential on-site sources of hydrocarbons. Soil samples collected from the three monitoring well borings were analyzed for TPHg and BTEX; samples collected from MW-3 boring located near the waste oil tank were additionally analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), halogenated volatile organics (HVO), total oil and grease (TOG) and chromium, total lead, nickel, and zinc. TPHg and BTEX were only detected in the soil sample collected from boring MW-1 at 6 feet below ground surface (TPHg at a concentration of 3,200 ppm, and low levels of ethylbenzene, toluene, and total xylenes). Neither TPHd, HVO, nor TOG were detected in the soil sampled collected from MW-3; metal concentrations detected in the soil sample collected from boring MW-3 were determined to be consistent with native background levels. Groundwater samples collected from all wells were analyzed for TPHg and BTEX. The water sample from well MW-3 was additionally analyzed for metals however was not analyzed for TPHd, HVO, or TOG as these compounds were not detected in concentrations exceeding the method limit in the soil sample collected from that boring. TPHg and BTEX were detected in the water sample collected from MW-1 (TPHg at 34,000 ug\/l, benzene at 7,000 ug\/l, toluene at 1,700 ug\/l, ethylbenzene at 2,500 ug\/l, and total  xylenes at 6,900 ug\/l); benzene was the only hydrocarbon detected in the water sample from MW-3 at a concentration of 0.95 ug\/l. No analytes were detected in MW-2.    In March 1993, HETI installed two off-site groundwater monitoring wells (MW-4 and MW-5) to further delineate soil and groundwater contamination.  Soil and water samples were analyzed for TPHg and BTEX. Neither analyte was detected in concentrations exceeding the method detection limit in soil or water samples collected from MW-4 and MW-5.  Based on the site's analytical data as well as data from an adjacent downgradient LUFT site (Chevron Station l#9-0290 located at 1802 Webster Street) groundwater monitoring well that had no historic detections ofTPHg or BTEX, HETI concluded that the extent of hydrocarbons in the subsurface soil centered in the vicinity of the USTs did not extend beyond the locations of  wells MW-2, MW-3, MW-4, and MW-5. HETI further concluded that the dissolved plume is also centered in the vicinity of the UST tank complex and did not extend beyond the locations of monitoring wells MW-2, MW-3, MW-4, MW-5, and Chevron well B-6.    In August 1993, HETI conducted a combined groundwater extraction\/ soil vapor extraction pilot test. Field activities included installation of a groundwater and soil vapor recovery well (RW-1) adjacent to the UST pit and two soil vapor monitoring points. No soil samples were collected during drilling. Results of the test indicated that soil vapor extraction (SVE) combined with groundwater extraction would be an effective remediation alternative for the site.    In mid 1994, BP sold the station to ConocoPhillips.   In November 1994, Fugro West advanced four CPT borings and collected grab groundwater samples at 10 to 13 feet below ground surface (ft bgs) along the sanitary sewer alignment in Webster Street and Buena Vista Avenue to investigate the potential for the trench backfill to act as a preferential pathway for contaminant migration. Groundwater samples were analyzed for TPHg and BTEX. TPHg was not detected in any of the groundwater samples. Low concentrations of benzene and\/or toluene were detected in groundwater samples collected in two of the four borings. Based on these results, Fugro concluded the sewer line trenches do not appear to contain concentrations of fuel constituents exceeding applicable action levels, or to act as preferential flow paths for hydrocarbon impacted groundwater.    In October 1995, MTBE was added to the list of analytes for groundwater samples collected from site monitoring wells. Concentrations of MTBE detected in samples collected from wells MW-1 and RW-1 were 15,000 and 4,300 micograms per liter (ug\/l), respectively.    From 1996 until 2009, groundwater monitoring events were coordinated with the adjacent downgradient Chevron station site. Groundwater elevation contour maps presented in groundwater monitoring reports for the site were generated using groundwater elevations from monitoring wells at both sites, and historic analytical results for TPH-DRO, TPH-GRO, BTEX, MTBE, and TOG from the Chevron Station #9-0290 wells B-6 and B-7 used to delineate the gasoline plume in the down-gradient direction. Prior to 1994, no analytes were been detected above method detection limits in wells B-6 and B-7. TPH-DRO started being detected in well B-6 starting in November 1994. In February 1997, MTBE and TPHg concentrations in groundwater samples collected from wells MW-1 and RW-1 spiked to 160,000 ug\/l and 150,000 ug\/l MTBE, respectively, and 180,000 ug\/l and 170,000 ug\/l TPHg, indicating an unauthorized release had occurred. TPHg and MTBE concentrations continued to increase in groundwater samples collected from well MW-1 through January 1998, and in well RW-1 through September 1998 before concentrations began to decrease.  During this time, BP noted that the UST system required upgrading to comply with 1998 federal requirements for leak detection and prevention and that lack of an overfill protection device, dispenser pans and spill buckets around the fill tubes for the USTs likely explained the variable and increasing MTBE concentrations detected in groundwater samples. MTBE began being detected in downgradient well B-6 in February 1999 when MTBE was added to the list of analytes.    In June 1999, TRC Alton Geoscience conducted a dual-phase extraction pilot test at the site using existing well RW-1 as the extraction well. After 1999, groundwater co-monitoring activities with the Chevron Station ceased and groundwater monitoring reports for the site have only included analytical data for wells MW-1, MW-2, MW-3, MW-4, MW-5 and RW-1.    In October 2010 Alisto Engineering Group conducted a potential receptor survey.  No domestic or municipal supply wells were identified within a 1\/2 mile radius of the site.  In 2009, ConocoPhillips sold the station to United Brothers Enterprise, Inc. (UBE), who subsequently converted one of the 6,000 gallon gasoline tanks to hold diesel product in the same year. During the third quarter 2011 groundwater monitoring event, conducted in July 2011, Broadbent &amp; Associates, Inc. (BAI) observed free product in well RW-1, immediately adjacent to the diesel tank. No free product had been detected in any of the site's monitoring wells prior to this time. In August 2011, BAI collected a sample of the free product in RW-1 and one sample each from the low, mid, and high octane unleaded gasoline dispensers. No sample was collected from the diesel dispenser.   The four samples were submitted to Torkelson Geochemistry, Inc.  to be analyzed by  capillary gas chromatography  analysis. Based on the results of the hydrocarbon fingerprint analysis, Torkelson concluded that the chromatogram of the free product in RW-1 has some of the characteristics of a middle distillate either diesel fuel or fuel oil, and states that although the RW-1 chromatogram is not typical of diesel or fuel oil chromatograms he has seen, it does not rule out the possibility that RW-1 is some unique formulation of diesel fuel or fuel oil. Based on these results, closure Solutions Inc concluded that at this time the free product in RW-1 cannot be identified and does not appear to be a fuel product form former operations at the Site. Free product was again observed in well RW-1 during 2012 groundwater monitoring events. Due to the presence of free product in the well, no groundwater samples were collected and submitted for analysis. TPH-DRO concentrations spiked in the downgradient Chevron station well B-6 in late 2009 and then again in mid 2010.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is a residence at the corner of 9th Street and Pacific Avenue in Alameda, California.  Surrounding land use is also residential.  On September 18, 1996, one 750 gallon home heating oil underground storage tank (UST) was removed from the site.  Several holes up to ¼-inch in diameter were observed during UST removal.  Odor and staining were observed in soils surrounding the USTs with the most apparent presence of petroleum hydrocarbons observed in the south end of the excavation at the fill end of the tank.  Three soil samples collected during UST removal contained up to 800 ppm TPH as diesel and 3.6 ppm benzene.    On September 25, 1996, one 120-gallon gasoline UST was removed from the site.  The gasoline UST was reportedly installed in 1926 and had not been used for more than 18 years prior to removal in 1996.  No residual product was present and the UST had several large holes in the bottom of the tank.  Soils surrounding the UST had no odor or staining.  Two soil samples collected below the UST did not contain petroleum hydrocarbons at concentrations above the reporting limits.      On May 13 and 14, 1997, five soil borings (B-1 through B-5) were advanced to evaluate the extent of petroleum hydrocarbons in the area of the former heating oil UST.  Eighteen soil samples were collected from the borings and grab groundwater samples were collected from the five borings.  TPH as diesel was detected in soil at concentrations up to 9,200 ppm in soil samples from B-3 and B-4.  TPH as diesel was detected in the grab groundwater samples at concentrations up to 430,000 ppb (B-4).  Based on a comparison of the grab groundwater sampling results to sampling results for groundwater samples collected from nearby monitoring wells, the grab groundwater sampling results appear to be biased high.    On October 9, 2002, four soil borings (MW-1 through MW-3 and SB-1\/TW) were advanced.  Soil borings MW-1 through MW-3 were converted into groundwater monitoring wells installed to a depth of 20 feet bgs.  Soil boring SB-1\/TW was converted into a temporary groundwater monitoring well.  TPH as diesel was detected in 4 of the 6 soil samples collected at concentrations up to 28,300 ppm.  TPH as diesel was detected in groundwater from monitoring well MW-2 at a concentration of 4,490 ppb but was not detected in groundwater samples from the remaining three wells.      Monitoring wells MW-1 through MW-3 were sampled on a quarterly basis from October 17, 2002 through October 24, 2003.  The concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons detected were variable during the one year period of groundwater monitoring.  TPH as diesel was detected in a groundwater sample collected from well MW-1 on October 24, 2003 at a concentration of 32,500 ppb.  However, during the three previous sampling events for MW-1, TPH as diesel was detected at a maximum concentration of 130 ppb.  The concentration of TPH as diesel detected in groundwater samples from well MW-2 varied from 620 to 4,490 ppb.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently a police department and is located near the corner of Lincoln Avenue and Oak Street in Alameda, California.  Surrounding land use is mixed commercial and residential.  The surrounding properties are mostly commercial, with the Alameda Library to the southeast and Alameda City Hall to the southwest of the site.      According to Alameda County’s records, a 6,000 gallon diesel underground storage tank (UST) was installed in 1977, the UST system was upgraded in 1999, and is still in use.  A compliance monitoring well was installed on June 4, 1986 to monitor the onsite 6,000 gallon diesel underground storage tank (UST).  Depth to water was measured at 7.5 feet below the ground surface (bgs) during the monitoring well installation.  A groundwater sample collected from the monitoring well on June 9, 1986 contained 1,600 parts per billion (ppb) total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHD).  Between 1986 and 2011 there are no records indicating that the monitoring well was sampled.    On December 28, 2011, three direct-push soil borings (B-1, B-2, and B-3) were advanced to determine the extent of the previously reported groundwater contamination and the monitoring well was redeveloped and sampled.  Soil samples from the borings were collected at or just above the soil-water interface.  No staining or odors were observed in soil removed from the borings.   All soil and grab groundwater samples, except for one groundwater sample, were found not to contain detectable concentrations of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHD) and benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and total xylenes (BTEX), MTBE, TBA, DIPE, ETBE, TAME, EDB, and EDC.  270 ppb TPHD was detected in the grab groundwater sample from boring B-2 located approximately 10 feet north of the UST.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "On August 1, 1996, three leaded gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs) were filled with an inert material and closed in-place at the Site. In 1996, several soil and one grab groundwater samples were taken at the Site. These samples contained low to non-detect (ND) gasoline (TPH-g), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzeme, xylenes (BTEX), and MtBE. Elevated lead was detected at up to 62 mg\/kg in soil and   840 µg\/L in groundwater.    Groundwater monitoring wells from a nearby closed underground tank site located at 1260 Park Street indicates that groundwater flow direction vary from the west to the northwest and that the groundwater depth ranges from 7.66 to 18.43 feet below ground surface. A 2015 sensitive receptor survey indicated that 25 properties within 2,000 feet of the Site have water wells including: irrigation wells, domestic wells, monitoring wells, extraction wells, test wells, cathodic protection wells, and wells that have already been abandoned. Eight of these identified properties are located downgradient of the Site. To assess the current extent and magnitude of the soil and groundwater pollution, soil and grab groundwater samples from five locations including one expected upgradient\/background location were collected in 2015. Samples were analyzed for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) diesel range organics (TPH-d), TPH-g, BTEX, naphthalene, MtBE, fuel oxygenates, ethylene dibromide, 1,2-Dichloroethylene, and total\/dissolved lead.  All of the soil and grab groundwater samples contained to ND concentrations of TPH-d, TPH-g, BTEX, naphthalene, MTBE, fuel oxygenates, ethylene dibromide, 1,2-Dichloroethylene, and total\/dissolved lead except for one grab groundwater sample (B-2) with 3,900 µg\/L of TPH-d. This sample was re-extracted twice and yielded results of 250 µg\/L and 820 µg\/L for TPH-d. Three additional grab groundwater samples downgradient of B-2 contained ND concentrations of TPH-d.    This case meets the low-threat closure criteria in the State Water Resources Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy  (LTCP), as shown below.    General Criteria  a. The Site is located within the service area of the East Bay Municipal Utility District;  b. The unauthorized release consists only of petroleum;  c. The “primary” release date is estimated prior to 1996 and the Site’s primary release has been stopped.  d. No Petroleum free product has been detected at the Site;  e. A conceptual site model that assesses the nature, extent, and mobility of the release has been developed;  f. Remaining hydrocarbon concentrations in soil and groundwater are low or ND and are expected to continue to degrade. Therefore, secondary source has been removed to the extent practicable;  g. Soil and groundwater has been tested for MtBE and results reported in accordance with Health and Safety Code section 25296.15; and  h. Nuisance as defined by California Water Code section 13050 does not exist at the Site.    Media Specific Criteria  1. Groundwater - The Site satisfies Class 1 of the groundwater specific criteria. The petroleum hydrocarbon plume has a predicted maximum length of less than approximately 100 feet, no petroleum free product has been reported at the Site, and there are no water supply wells within 250 feet of the Site.  2. Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air – The Site satisfies Scenario3A of the vapor intrusion specific criteria. Benzene concentration in groundwater is less than 100 µg\/L and the total TPH (TPH-g and TPH-d combined) is less than 100 mg\/kg within the top five feet of soil.  3. Direct contact and outdoor air exposure - Benzene, ethylbenzene, and naphthalene soil concentrations do not exceed the direct contact and outdoor air exposure criteria for residential and commercial\/industrial uses.",

No discoloration, odors or other signs of a release noted in piping trench and UST pit.  Groundwater was encountered in tank pit at 6 feet bgs (no odors observed or sheen on water); consequently soil samples beneath the UST were not collected. One 4-point composite stockpile soil sample was collected and concentrations were below appropriate reporting limits for all analytes tested (TPHd and BTEX and MTBE).  A grab groundwater sample contained TPHd concentrations of 2,400 ug\/L, however EPA Method 8015M was used without silica gel cleanup. Site is located immediately adjacent to Alameda Inner Harbor Channel, and therefore grab groundwater sample likely had high non TPH organic content and likely skewed TPH results. No further work has been conducted.  No volatiles in soil or groundwater therefore site poses low risk under LTCP.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently a retail center located at the corner of Lincoln Avenue and Oak Street in Alameda, California.  Surrounding land use is mixed commercial and residential.  The site reportedly operated as a gasoline service station from 1926 until 1982.  Underground storage tanks were installed at the site in 1958 with additional USTs installed in 1970.  USTs were installed in two separate areas referred to as the western and eastern tank areas.  Sometime between 1950 and 1965, the original service station in the southwestern corner of the site was demolished and a second service station that covered the entire site was constructed.  In 1982, the USTs and service station were removed and the site was redeveloped into the current retail center.      A Phase II Environmental Site Assessment was performed by Basics Environmental in 1999.  Six soil borings (SB-1 through SB-6) were advanced in the western portion of the site.  One soil sample was collected from each soil boring and grab groundwater samples were collected from five of the six borings.  Total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) were detected in soil and groundwater at concentrations up to 40 ppm and 4,500 ppb, respectively.     In August 2000, Toxichem Management Systems, Inc. conducted a site assessment that included a review of the previous site investigation data, aerial photos, Sanborn maps, and agency files.    In February 2007, Geomatrix installed three groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-3) in the western UST area and advanced 11 soil borings (EB-1 through EB-6 and EB-8 through EB-11) in the eastern UST and dispenser area.  Soil samples contained up to 1,600 ppm of TPHg and 0.99 ppm of benzene.  Grab groundwater samples collected from the wells and exploratory borings contained up to 7,000 ppb of TPHg and 980 ppb of benzene.     In February 2009, Conestoga-Rovers &amp; Associates installed five monitoring wells (MW-4 through MW-8), installed five soil vapor probes (SVP-1 through SVP-5), and advanced three soil borings (B-5, B-7, and B-8).  TPHg was detected in soil at concentrations up to 7,900 ppm.  Benzene, toluene, and MTBE were not detected at concentrations exceeding reporting limits in soil.  TPHg and benzene were detected in grab groundwater samples from the soil borings at concentrations up to 470 ppb and 2 ppb, respectively.  Soil vapor from probe SVP-5 contained TPHg at a concentration of 11,000,000 micrograms per cubic meter (µg\/m3) and benzene at a concentration of 12,000 µg\/m3.      In March 2010, CRA installed one groundwater monitoring well (MW-9), installed four soil vapor probes (SVP-5A and SVP-6 through SVP-8), and reinstalled one soil vapor probe (SVP-4).  No TPHg or BTEX were detected at concentrations exceeding reporting limits in soil samples collected from the MW-9 soil boring.      Six soil vapor probes were sampled in June and July 2010.  TPHg and ethylbenzene were detected in soil vapor collected from 5 feet bgs from probe SVP-5 at concentrations of 8,400,000 and 14,000 µg\/m3, respectively.  The concentrations of TPHg, BTEX, and MTBE were less than reporting limits in the remaining soil vapor samples.     In July 2010, one off-site boring (B-6) was advanced at a former 76 station located immediately west of the site.  No TPHg, TPHd, TPHmo, BTEX, or fuel oxygenates were detected in soil samples from boring B-6.  TPHg, BTEX, and fuel oxygenates were not detected at concentrations exceeding reporting limits in the grab groundwater sample collected from off-site boring B-6.  TPHd was detected in the grab groundwater sample at a concentration of 56 ppb.    Groundwater monitoring wells MW-1 through MW-3 were initially sampled in August 2007.  Quarterly groundwater monitoring was conducted at the site from March 2009 up to September 2010.  Groundwater monitoring was suspended following the September 2010 sampling event.      In March 2011, soil vapor probe SVP-9 was installed in the eastern tank area.   A soil vapor sample collected from 4.5 feet bgs in SVP-9 contained 18,000 µg\/m3 of TPHg and 52 µg\/m3 of benzene.  A soil vapor sample collected from 2.0 feet bgs in SVP-9 did not contain TPHg or BTEX at concentrations exceeding reporting limits.      Two excavations were advanced at the site between April 11 and April 19, 2011.  One excavation was advanced in the eastern tank area surrounding soil vapor probe SVP-5 to remove residual petroleum hydrocarbons.  A second excavation was advanced in the area of the former dispensers to remove soil with residual lead.  The petroleum excavation extended to a depth of approximately 13.5 feet bgs.  Confirmation soil samples from the petroleum excavation contained up to 166 ppm of TPHg, 0.05 ppm of benzene, and 2.24 ppm of ethylbenzene.  Toluene, xylenes, and MTBE were not detected in the confirmation soil samples.  Confirmation soil samples from the lead excavation contained soil at concentrations of 15 to 150 ppm.  Approximately 56 tons of soil was excavated and disposed off-site at the Keller Canyon Landfill in Pittsburg, California.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In October 1986 two USTs were removed from the site and confirmation samples collected from the bottom of the tank pit detected significantly elevated levels of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in soil. In April 1987 a preliminary site assessment was completed and five soil borings and three groundwater monitoring wells were installed and free product and elevated levels of TPHg and benzene were detected in soil and groundwater. Groundwater monitoring commenced in 1989 and was discontinued in 2003. In 2008 further site characterization detected significantly elevated level of contamination in soil and groundwater. High concentrations of TPHg and benzene remain in soil beneath the site, the extent of contamination is undefined and remedial action is feasible to reduce soure mass and reduce impacts to groundwater.  Pilot Study conducted 12\/2011.    Interim remedial activities were conducted between December 2011 and November 2013 and included a High Volume Duel Phase Extraction pilot study, excavation of the UST pit and hydraulic lifts, and overexcavation of the former hydraulic lifts in the vicinity of well DPE-5, where free product was found.  Soil vapor samples were collected between May 2012 and November 2013.",

CAA 3 is subdivided into three areas designated as CAAs 3A, 3B, and 3C. The landscape island of CAA 3C was a former fuel storage area that consisted of five 100,000-gallon aviation gasoline storage tanks, of which UST 97-A is one. Based on inventory reconciliation records, the Navy estimated 365,000 gallons of fuel may have been released from the fuel storage area during the 1960s and early 1970s. Additionally, an undetermined amount of fuel leaked from fuel lines connecting the aviation gasoline tanks in CAA 3C to the fuel dispensing facilities in CAA 3B.",

Subsurface investigation conducted to date have included the following:    August 2001: Five soil borings were installed. Soil samples were analyzed for gasoline, medium to high weight total petroleum hydrocarbons, title 22 metals, and volatile organic compounds. Soil concentrations were indicative of an unauthorized release at the property    June 2002: chemical impacted soils were excavated at two locations near the former lathe equipment area (4 feet by 4 feet and five feet in depth) and in the open yard (11 feet by 6 feet by 3 feet in  depth).    October 2002: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment was conducted on behalf of a financial lending institution, U.S. Bank    December 2002: twelve soil borings were installed. Soil samples were collected out of 10 of these borings, and grab groundwater samples were collected out of two of the borings. Soil was analyzed for diesel, motor oil, stoddard solvent, lead, and volatile organic compounds. Elevated petroleum hydrocarbon were detected in shallow soil at depths ranging from 0.5 to 1 foot bgs. Petroleum hydrocarbons were not detected in grab groundwater samples, but low levels of naphthalene, toluene, and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene was detected.    October 24, 2003: Soil excavation work was conducted at four areas with known chemical impacts to soil. Confirmation soil samples were collected and indicated that soil concentrations remaining are below data quality objectives except for Excavation Area D and Excavation Area A which reported diesel concentrations ranging from 380 mg\/kg to 17,000 mg\/kg with laboratory comment that the chromatogram resembles hydrocarbons heavier than diesel. However, excavation at Area D could not be laterally or vertically extended without causing damage to the structure and its foundation. A request for no further action had been requested at this time.     A review (3\/13\/2020) of the case file indicates that the only human health risk associated at the site is direct contact exposure for residential shallow soil exposure for diesel and lead.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Two generations of underground storage tank (UST) systems containing gasoline and waste oil were located at the former Good Chevrolet Auto Dealership. Fuel Leak Case RO0000008 was opened by Alameda County Environmental Health (ACEH) in 1986 due to the discovery of a release of petroleum hydrocarbons after the removal of the two first generation USTs (a 300-gallon waste oil tank and 500-gallon gasoline tank) located in the northern part of the site. In July 2011, three soil borings were advanced adjacent to the three second generation USTs (a 10,000-gallon gasoline tank, a 4,000-gallon gasoline tank, and a 500-gallon waste oil tank) installed in the 1980’s in the southern portion of the site. The analytical results from soil and grab groundwater samples did not find evidence that a release had occurred.  In November 2011, the second generation USTs were removed.  Holes were not observed in the three USTs during removal and petroleum hydrocarbons were not detected in soil samples collected beneath the two gasoline USTs or dispensers. However, a grab groundwater sample collected from the gasoline tank pit detected Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHG) and benzene.  Soil beneath the waste oil tank had odor and visual evidence of petroleum hydrocarbon impact.  A soil sample collected beneath the waste oil tank at a depth of 9 feet detected TPHG, TPH as diesel (TPHD), and Petroleum Oil and Grease (POG). The waste oil pit was overexcavated to a depth of 11 feet, resampled, and no detections of TPHG, TPHD or POG were found.  Due the low concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons detected in soil and groundwater in the vicinity of the second generation tanks on Parcel A, ACEH opened a new Fuel Leak Case (RO0003112) to decouple Parcel A from Parcel B and allow separate development of each parcel.    During the start of site grading, two USTs were discovered; tank removal occurred 10\/29\/2013 and a work plan for interim remedial action (overexcavation) was submitted  to ACEH on 10\/31\/2013",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is located in a residential area of Alameda and is currently developed as a multi-unit residential apartment building consisting of one parcel currently pending a property transaction.    In June 2017, one approximately 750-gallon single-walled steel heating oil underground storage tank (UST) was removed from the site.  The UST was observed to be in poor condition with multiple visible holes; no soil discoloration or hydrocarbon odors were observed in the tank excavation, overburden soil, or soil underlying the tank.  Groundwater and product (sheen) was observed in the excavation area immediately following tank removal activities at approximately 8 feet below ground surface.  Soil and groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon as diesel (TPH d), Naphthalene, Benzene Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Total Xylenes.  Concentrations of TPH-d in soil were reported at 29 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) from the only confirmation sample collected from below the northwest end of the tank at 8 feet below ground surface (bgs).      On June 16, 2017 approximately 1,300-gallons of groundwater and floating product were removed from the tank cavity.  One grab groundwater sample was collected from the bottom of the tank cavity after removal of the recharged water at a depth of approximately 8 feet bgs.  Results indicated TPH-d in groundwater was reported at 480 micrograms per liter (ug\/l).    Additional subsurface characterization activities are documented in the Subsurface Environmental Investigation Report (the Report) dated May 4, 2018 which included results of soil, grab groundwater, sump water, and soil vapor samples collected within the vicinity of the former underground storage tank (UST), within the sump in the interior of the underground garage, and adjacent to the subject site (the Site) to assess potential preferential pathway vapor intrusion from subsurface utilities entering the building.  The Report documented the results of the soil and groundwater samples to further delineate the nature and extent of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPH-g), diesel (TPH d), and motor oil (TPH-mo) in the subsurface initially identified during tank removal activities in June 2017.  The Report indicated TPH-d was reported up to 3,000 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) in sample EB-1 at a depth of 10 to 10.5 feet below ground surface (bgs) below the reported bottom of the former UST area.  Trace TPH-d was also detected in soil borings EB-2 and EB-5 at shallow depths (approximately 4 feet bgs).  Grab groundwater results reported TPH-d up to 4,100 micrograms per liter (µg\/l) in EB-1 located in the former tank excavation area and up 280 µg\/l in EB-3 located adjacent (southeast) to the former underground storage tank (UST) excavation area    Based on results presented in the above mentioned Report, Green proposed interim remedial activities outlined in the Interim Remedial Action Work Plan (the Work Plan) dated September 21, 2018 including; remedial excavation of approximately twenty cubic yards of petroleum impacted soil by excavation including the removal of approximately a 10 foot by 10 foot area to a total depth of approximately 13 feet bgs centered in the vicinity of the highest impacted soil reported at EB-1 and soil beneath boring EB-3.  Due to the depth of residual secondary source within the former (UST) excavation area and shallow groundwater observed at the Site, the Work Plan proposes the use of shoring and dewatering to facilitate residual secondary source removal.  Groundwater dewatering would include mobilization of an 8,000-gallon tank to hold extracted groundwater and offsite disposal.    Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has evaluated the data presented in the above-mentioned Report and Work Plan, respectively, in conjunction with the case files, and the State Water Resources Control Board’s (SWRCBs) Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (LTCP). Based on our review, ACDEH has determined that the Site meets the media specific criteria for groundwater, vapor intrusion and direct contact under the LTCP.  Although residual secondary source remains in the former UST excavation area, ACDEH is of the opinion that there is not a demonstrated threat to human health or environment if left in place.  Additionally, due to site constraints discussed above, removal of residual secondary source would not be a cost effective corrective action.  Therefore it is the opinion of this agency that additional secondary source removal is not required at the Site.    Chloroform was reported at 8 micrograms per cubic meter (ìg\/m3) in soil vapor sample VP-1 collected in the landscaped areas adjacent to the onsite residential structure. ACDEH notes this chloroform vapor concentration is above the January 2019 San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board’s environmental screening levels (ESL) for human health risks from soil gas vapor intrusion under the residential scenario. While regulatory oversight under the LUST program is limited to investigation and cleanup of underground storage tank related petroleum hydrocarbon releases, if determined that additional investigation is warranted to evaluate chloroform impacts, a separate Site Cleanup Program case would be required and opened.",

So, while all Individual Sites may be closed, the CAA Site may still remain open with residual contamination not associated with the Individual Sites located within the CAA.    CAA 3 is an approximately 8-acre site that is located in the eastern portion of Alameda Point. The area was originally tidal flats, but it was filled and developed by the end of World War II. CAA 3 is subdivided into three areas designated as CAAs 3A, 3B, and 3C. Currently, Building 398 at CAA 3A is occupied by tenants who operate an engine testing facility and an electronics recycling business. CAA 3B is primarily paved open space, and CAA 3C includes the westbound portion of Atlantic Avenue and a landscaped island at the main east entrance to Alameda Point.Petroleum fuel releases occurred at each of the CAAs. At CAA 3A, jet fuel propellant no. 5 (jet fuel) was reported to have been released from two underground storage tanks adjacent to Building 398. The landscape island of CAA 3C was a former fuel storage area that consisted of five 100,000-gallon aviation gasoline storage tanks. Based on inventory reconciliation records, the Navy estimated 365,000 gallons of fuel may have been released from the fuel storage area during the 1960s and early 1970s. Additionally, an undetermined amount of fuel leaked from fuel lines connecting the aviation gasoline tanks in CAA 3C to the fuel dispensing facilities in CAA 3B.",

The facility consists of a tank farm that contained 29 oil storage tanks in 1951 and held 48 aboveground bulk storage tanks as of 1998 when the Site Cleanup Requirements were issued (Order No. 98-121). The 48 tanks have a combined capacity of 3,045,758 gallons. Lubricating oils were discovered in the tank farm area in 1985 and additional oil was spilled in this area in 1990. Additional contaminated soil was discovered during later site inspections. Contaminated soil was removed in 2002, however some contaminated soil was left under aboveground storage tanks to maintain their structural integrity. Permit violations were discovered in 2006 and 2008 resulting in the issuance of a Notice of Violation in 2009. Contamination at this facility is also attributed to former USTs adjacent to the shipping area and USTs located east of the aboveground tank containment area, under the warehouse. Groundwater monitoring was conducted quarterly starting in 1995 and semiannually beginning in 2009.    Cleanup was completed in 2021 and the property sold by Shell, case is now closed.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is an active commercial service station.  This site is the location of a previous fuel leak case, ACDEH case number RO0001042, closed on March 15, 1999.  Case RO0001042 was opened as the result of a release discovered during the removal and replacement of a waste oil UST.  Data associated with RO0001042 was not included in the evaluation of the current case closure.  Fuel release case RO0002745 was opened as a result of penetration of a gasoline UST which occurred in August 2004 during station upgrades when a filled 10,000 gallon gasoline UST was unknowingly punctured during installation, releasing an estimated 2,048 gallons of gasoline fuel.   As a result of an emergency response, an estimated 1,997 gallons of gasoline was recovered within the 3 months following the release.  Investigation and groundwater monitoring indicated this case may have a MTBE contaminant plume co-mingled with the former Unocal station, ACDEH case number RO0000450, which was located at 1629 Webster Street and down gradient of the site.      This UST fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  Case closure is granted for the current commercial land use as an active fueling station.    Due to residual subsurface contamination remaining at the site, if any redevelopment occurs, or if a proposed change in land use to residential, or other conservative land use, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.    Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently developed as a commercial business and is located southeast of the intersection of Blanding Avenue and Everett Street in Alameda, California.  Surrounding property use is mixed commercial and residential.  The site has reportedly been used as a business since the 1930’s.  The property is currently occupied by Kerry and Chris Smith Construction.    According to the City of Alameda Fire Department, a 550-gallon gasoline underground storage tank (UST) was reportedly installed at the site in approximately 1931 and according to the current property owner the UST was removed sometime between 1982 and 1984.  However, no records documenting the UST’s removal or installation have been submitted.  The tank was reported by the property owner to have been located along the southeast property line of the site, four feet below the unpaved portion of the driveway.    November 6, 2009: Three soil borings (SB1 through SB3) were advanced in the reported area of the former UST.  Three soil samples were collected from the borings at a depth of seven feet below ground surface (bgs) in addition to two grab groundwater samples.  Soil samples detected up to 550 parts per million (ppm) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), 100 ppm Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), and 110 ppm Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as motor oil (TPHmo).  Petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in the soil sample collected from the western portion of the UST area (SB1).  The grab groundwater samples detected up to 4,900 parts per billion (ppb) TPHg, 14,000 ppb TPHd, 15,000 ppb TPHmo, and 14 ppb benzene.  Groundwater was first encountered at a depth of 6.0 to 7.5 feet bgs and evidence of contamination was first noted in all three soil borings at a depth of 6.0 feet bgs.    August 3, 2011:  Three soil borings (SB1-2 through SB-3-2) were advanced in locations one to two feet north (downgradient) of the previous SB-1 through SB-3 borings.  Grab groundwater samples, but no soil samples, were collected from each of the borings.  Up to 100 ppb TPHd and 150 ppb TPHmo were detected in groundwater.  Groundwater contamination was detected in the grab groundwater sample, located in the western portion of the former UST area (SB1-2).    November 16, 2012:  Four soil borings (SB-4 through SB-7) were advanced in and adjacent to the former UST area at depths ranging between 10 and 12 feet bgs.  Three soil samples were collected from each of the borings (12 total) at depths of four, six, and eight feet bgs.  Grab groundwater samples were also collected from each boring.  The soil sample collected in the eastern portion of the former UST area (SB-5) at a depth of 4 feet bgs detected TPHd at 13 ppm.  Grab groundwater samples detected 1.3 ppb ethylbenzene and 9.1 ppb xylenes.",

A fuel leak case (RO0000025) was opened in 1993 in response to the discovery of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater from two soil borings.  Fuel leak case RO0000025 was closed on December 27, 2001 with risk management measures and restrictions on future land use.  Site investigation was completed to address data gaps in the previous site investigations and evaluate the site for residential land use.  Redevelopment of the Islander Motel for residential use and construction of two adjacent builidings has been approved.  Redevelopmetn of the site has been completed including removal of soil contamination containing heavy chain petroleum hydrocarbons in the elevator area.",

Contamination present within the larger CAA Site may be co-mingled with the smaller Individual Sites. So, while all Individual Sites may be closed, the CAA Site may still remain open with residual contamination not associated with the Individual Sites located within the CAA.    CAA 3 is an approximately 8-acre site that is located in the eastern portion of Alameda Point. The area was originally tidal flats, but it was filled and developed by the end of World War II. CAA 3 is subdivided into three areas designated as CAAs 3A, 3B, and 3C. Currently, Building 398 at CAA 3A is occupied by tenants who operate an engine testing facility and an electronics recycling business. CAA 3B is primarily paved open space, and CAA 3C includes the westbound portion of Atlantic Avenue and a landscaped island at the main east entrance to Alameda Point.Petroleum fuel releases occurred at each of the CAAs. At CAA 3A, jet fuel propellant no. 5 (jet fuel) was reported to have been released from two underground storage tanks adjacent to Building 398. The landscape island of CAA 3C was a former fuel storage area that consisted of five 100,000-gallon aviation gasoline storage tanks. Based on inventory reconciliation records, the Navy estimated 365,000 gallons of fuel may have been released from the fuel storage area during the 1960s and early 1970s. Additionally, an undetermined amount of fuel leaked from fuel lines connecting the aviation gasoline tanks in CAA 3C to the fuel dispensing facilities in CAA 3B.",

A water sample taken on May 1, 2017 detected concentrations up to 41,400 micrograms per liter (ug\/L) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), 4,050 ug\/L fuel oil, and 363 ug\/L TPH as gasoline (TPHg).  These data document an unauthorized release of petroleum hydrocarbons at the site.    An environmental investigation was conducted in 2018 that included collection of soil and groundwater samples from four soil borings.

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at:    http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm    The subject site (APN 74-427-5-1) is located at 1435 Webster Street in Alameda, CA. The site is currently used as a paved parking lot. The San Francisco Bay, the closest surface water body, is located approximately 1,430 feet southwest of the property. The direction of groundwater flow at the site is predominantly towards the southwest. There is an irrigation well located at a school at 1427 6th Street, Alameda, which is cross\/down gradient of the site at a distance of approximately 750 feet west of the site.  Based on the cross\/down gradient location of the well with respect to the site, the well is not expected to be a receptor for the site.    The site was used as a gasoline station between 1983 and 1989.  In September 1989 four underground storage tanks (USTs), (two 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs, one 7,500-gallon diesel UST, and one 500-gallon waste oil UST), two fuel dispensers and conveyance piping were removed from the site.  Concentrations up to 110 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), 200 mg\/kg TPH as diesel (TPHd), and 650 mg\/kg oil and grease were detected in soil samples taken during the UST removal.  In January 1991 and February 2007 contaminated soil was removed from the site.  Between 1993 and 2009 nine groundwater monitoring wells were installed to evaluate the dissolved groundwater plume. Between 1996 and 2006, several offsite investigations were completed to determine the lateral extent of dissolved phase contamination. An in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) pilot test (injection of hydrogen peroxide) was successfully conducted in 2011 and a corrective action plan was approved by ACEH, but was never implemented.  Five vapor monitoring wells were sampled between 2009 and 2011. In July 2014 an additional soil and groundwater investigation was conducted consisting of downgradient off-site plume definition, and on-site investigation at the former waste oil UST, the northern dispenser island, and the area adjacent to MW-8.  The Site Conceptual Model was updated, the remaining data gaps were successfully filled, and the data was found to support case closure to commercial standards under the Low Threat Closure Policy.",

In April 1994, three 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were removed from 1701 Park St. and a 110 gallon heating oil UST was removed from adjacent 2329 Buena Vista Avenue. Two 10,000-gallon USTs and a 7,000-gallon UST were installed in the old UST pit.  Confirmation soil samples collected from the gasoline UST pit detected elevated TPHg and benzene in soil.    Environmental investigations have been ongoing since 1994 and have included installation of a groundwater monitoring well network and collection of soil and groundwater samples. Numerous interim remedial actions and pilot studies have been implemented, but were found not to be effective. Ozone injection is about to be implemented.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The NMCRC is located along the south side of the Oakland Inner Harbor at 2144 Clement Avenue, Alameda, California. The site is currently used as a training facility for Naval and Marine Corps reserve units and staff for the Navy Operational Support Center. As shown on figure 2, the site currently contains a training building (building 1), a training building addition (building 5), a Marine Corps supply warehouse (building 2), a vechile maintenance garage (building 3), and a new vechile maintenance building (building 4). A boat ramp and additions to buildings 2 and 4 are currently being constructed.     In 1942, the U.S Goverment acquired title to the future NMCRC property for war time support of ship building. three graving docks (Graving Docks 2,3, and 4) were dredged to a depth of about 25 feet, and embankments were constructed adjacent to each. A fourth graving dock (Graving Dock 1) was positioned west of the site and appeared to be owned and operated by Pacific Bridge Company. Pacific Bridghe Company also operated the govermetn -owned shipyard during the war years.    During the 1950s, ship building activities had been \"mothballed\", but the site continued to be used as a reserve center. Various structural improvements were conducted that included conversion of warehouses, administrative buildings, and shops to training facilities. some buildings that supported ship building were demolished during this time perios between 1958 and 1960, existing wooden piers between the graving docks were removed and replaced with a single concrete pier between Graving Docks 3 and 4. At this time, the generator\/boiler house was relocted to the western side of the embankment between Graving Docks 3 and 4 (figure 2). A new 1,200-gallon fuel oil UST was installed south of the generator\/boiler house to fuel a boiler and generator that provided steam and electrical power to ships berthed at the new pier.    During the 1950s, and at least through 1959, J.H. Baxter and Co. leased a portion of the landward side of the graving docks for storage of creosote-treated poles. J.H. Baxter and Co. owned the adjacent land  east of the NMCRC and had conducted wood treatment operations at this site since 1923. the configuration of the \"pole yard\" east of the NMCRC included creosote wood treatment in the central-eastern portion of the property, and it included a tank farm for creosote and fuel oil products, a boiler room , and treatment tanks.    During the 1960s, a new NMCRC campus was constructed at the site. Reserve activities continued and ships continued to be berthed at the pier. the generator\/boiler house appeared to continue to be used. Graving Docks 3 and 4 were backfilled by 1963. the source of the backfill materials is not known. Graving Dock 2 was not backfilled at this time, and plans identify the southern portion of this graving dock as a \"Contractor Disposal Area\" (Figure 2). Graving Dock 2 was backfilled by 1966. Most of the remaining original ship building structures landward of the graving docks appear to have been removed with the construction of the training building (building 1) and the Vehicle Maintenance Garage\/Rifle Range Building (now USMC Supply Warehouse - Building 2). The area of the former graving docks was unpaved and appeared to be leased out for equipment storage and repair during the period of 1966 to 1967.    Reserve activities continued throughout the 1970s; although, the lack of larger training ships (destroyers and submarines) berthed at the pier suggests that the generator \/boiler house was no longer used. Between 1979 and 1984, Standard oil Compnay of Ohio leased the area of the former graving docks for module fabrication of North Slope Alaska oil exploration structures. the Large (920-ton) modules were moved with crawler transport westward to the adjoining property for loading onto barges for transport to Alaska. The generator\/boiler house may have been removed by this time.    During the 1990s, the New Vechile Maintenance Building (Building 4) and the Training Buildiing Addition (Building 5) were constructed. It was during the construction of these building that the environmental issue of the West Vault area was discovered. Paving the former graving docks area during the 1990's for the North Parking Lot revealed the former  fuel oil UST associated with the generator \/boiler house. A southeastern portion of the site was leased to the City of Alameda for transformer storage.    Three site improvement projects are currently being implemented at the NMCRC. A boat ramp is being constructed in the vicinity of the former embankment\/roadway and adjacent to the former wooden trestles between Graving Docks 2 and 3 (figure 2). An addition to building 4 is being constructed at the eastern end of the existing Building 4, and a new building just east of building 2 is being constructed. All of these construction projects began in the summer of 2011, and they are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2011.",

However, after the LUST case was opened, Chevron Environmental Management Company (CEMC) provided service station plans indicating that only a portion of the parcel, excluding the two-story brick building at 2407 San Jose Avenue, had been used as a service station.  Therefore, ACDEH split the existing case into two cases: a Site Cleanup Program (SCP) case RO0003253, 2407 San Jose Avenue, a brick building formerly used by Clamp-Swing Pricing Company and auto service garages and a LUST case RO0003230, 1200 Park Street, the remaining parcel not occupied by the brick building.    ACDEH has evaluated this SCP case for closure consistent with the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (SFBRWQCB) Environmental Screening Limits (ESLs) for TPHd, TPHmo, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and has determined that residual subsurface contamination at the site presents a low risk to human health and the environment. Therefore, case closure is granted for the current commercial land use as a vacant brick building.  If a change to a more conservative land use is proposed, or if any site modifications or building alterations, or redevelopment is planned, ACDEH must be notified and any below grade work requires planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The LTA tank was located in the Least Tern Nesting Area, which is in the runway area of Alameda Point.  The underground storage tank (UST) was 500 gallons in capacity and located inside a concrete vault.  The UST was used to store diesel to fuel a heater or boiler unit. Cleanup standards (i.e., environmental screening levels [ESLs] and preliminary remediation criteria [PRC]) are based on non-residential future land use (based on the plans for recreational\/national wildlife refuge use in the future) and groundwater that is not a potential drinking water source.  Although the site was not located within 250 ft of a storm sewer or surface water body, analytical data were also compared to the marine ecological receptor PRC.    Due to the release of some product during removal activities, overexcavation of soil was conducted (approximately 20 x 25 ft of soil to 6 ft bgs and additional soil to 0.5 ft bgs east of the excavation) and groundwater was purged from the excavation pit (approximately 1,200 gallons).  As directed by Water Board staff, the “before” data presented below represent historical data from around the time this tank was being used.  Seven soil samples from six locations were collected within 25 ft of the tank and 12 groundwater samples plus two duplicates from three locations were collected within 100 ft of the tank from 1991 until 2005 when the tank was removed.  Also as directed by Water Board staff, the “after” data presented below are more recent data that are representative of current conditions at the site.  Due to elevated concentrations that remained in the excavation pit groundwater after product removal, the Water Board requested that additional samples be collected to evaluate current conditions at the site and determine any migration was occurring.  Three groundwater samples at three locations were collected within 50 ft of the tank in 2011.  One sample was collected at the former location of the tank, a second sample was collected approximately 15 ft downgradient, and a third sample was collected approximately 30 ft downgradient of the former tank location.  As shown in the table below, naphthalene was the only compound detected in the groundwater samples collected in 2011, with the concentration being below the ESL and",

In April 1993 groundwater monitoring wells were installed to evaluate potential groundwater contamination and plume migration. Significant elevated levels of dissolved phase TPHg and BTEX and SPH were detected in monitoring wells. Source area impacts under the adjacent property at 2305 Santa Clara Ave.     Corrective action using Groundwater Recirculation Enhanced Bioremediation was conducted from November 2014 through December 2017. Operation of the recirculation system induced migration of petroleum compounds in groundwater onto neighboring properties.     In December 2017, ACDEH directed the responsible party to discontinue operation of the recirculation system, assess alternative cleanup approaches, and prepare a revised Corrective Action Plan (CAP). ACDEH met with the responsible party, the owner of 2305 Santa Clara Ave., and the City of Alameda in June 2018. The responsible party proposed to conduct excavation at the site pending approval of the City of Alameda to remove historic structures from the former service station. According to a 30 November 2018 letter from the responsible party to the ACDEH, the responsible party has not obtained city-approval to remove the historic structures.     ACDEH requires an alternatives analysis, a revised CAP, and remediation to reduce offsite petroleum concentrations in groundwater and soil gas. In addition, the revised CAP needs to include steps to prevent (1) offsite migration of petroleum compounds in groundwater, and (2) a change in site use that would result in unacceptable vapor intrusion to onsite structures.",

In approximately 2005 the dry cleaning operations began using a hydrocarbon-based system and discontinued use of PCE.  Three hand-augured borings to 5 feet bgs were installed in 200; a Phase I was conducted in 2013; six soil vapor wells, SV-1 through SV-6 were installed in August 2014; three groundwater monitoring wells were installed in November 2014; five vapor wells VW-1 through VW-5 were installed in November 2014. Investigation is on-going.    The Elegant Cleaners source area for groundwater and vapor appears to be located in the rear of the Elegant Cleaners building, the location of the dry cleaner machine, and behind the building in the unpaved parking lot. The Report’s Figure 4, PCE in Groundwater March 2017, and Figure 5, PCE in Subslab\/Soil Gas, March 2017, documented the existence of tetrachloroethene (PCE) in both groundwater and soil vapor on-and off-site.  Three site groundwater monitoring wells located in the unpaved parking lot behind the Elegant Cleaners building detected a maximum of 43 ug\/L PCE in April 2016.  Grab groundwater samples B-4 through B-7 were collected in Lincoln Avenue; B-5 detected 360 micrograms per liter (ug\/L) PCE. The extent of PCE in groundwater is undefined to the west and east of the source area, beneath the contiguous store front businesses on either side of the Elegant Cleaners building.

Files available at acgov.org (Local Oversight Program records). NFA letter dated 2\/6\/1996 by ACEH.     Regional Water Board issued a cleanup and abatement order May 3, 1994, for unauthorized disposal of fill materals to baylands without a permit.  Cleamup and Abatement order 94-004  is attached in site documents. Reportedly, 200-400 truck loads of fill were deposited on the shoreline at Encinal Terminals, and the fill materials included construction debris (broken concrete and asphalt) and soil containing an odor of rancid oils which were used as fill to elevate the shorline by 6 feet. The odors were abated after cleanup fill was added as cover. The Cleanup and Abatement Order 94-004 was rescinded on 12\/23\/1996. Case Closure granted 8\/5\/1997, with letter of Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements and Water Quality Certification.",

CAA 3 is an approximately 8-acre site that is located in the eastern portion of Alameda Point. The area was originally tidal flats, but it was filled and developed by the end of World War II. CAA 3 is subdivided into three areas designated as CAAs 3A, 3B, and 3C. The landscape island of CAA 3C was a former fuel storage area that consisted of five 100,000-gallon aviation gasoline storage tanks, of which UST 97-D is one. Based on inventory reconciliation records, the Navy estimated 365,000 gallons of fuel may have been released from the fuel storage area during the 1960s and early 1970s. Additionally, an undetermined amount of fuel leaked from fuel lines connecting the aviation gasoline tanks in CAA 3C to the fuel dispensing facilities in CAA 3B.",

If a change in land use to any commercial, residential, or other conservative land use scenario occurs at this site, Alameda County Environmental Health (ACEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACEH will re-evaluate the case upon receipt of approved development\/construction plans.     Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    _________________________________________________________________    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The site is located within the United States Coast Guard Integrated Support Command (USCG ISC Alameda) on the southwest side of Coast Guard Island and is surrounded on three sides by Coast Guard buildings.  The Oakland Estuary is approximately 50 feet southwest of the site.    November 19, 2001 - Underground Storage Tank (UST) removal: A 10,000-gallon double walled fiberglass UST  installed in 1985 and used to store oily water and bilge water from USCG ships was removed from the site.  The UST was cleaned and approximately 700 gallons of oily water, 200 to 300 gallons of sandy sludge, and 500 gallons of wastewater were removed from the tank and disposed of as hazardous waste.  No holes were observed in the UST, but oily spots were observed around the tank manhole.  The UST’s manhole was secured by one bolt and there was a 2-inch gap between the lid and the manhole.  Groundwater was observed at 7.5 feet below ground surface (bgs) in the northeastern portion of the excavation and a black sheen was observed on groundwater in the tank excavation.  Pea gravel covering the UST was stockpiled northeast of the UST pit and had an obvious petroleum hydrocarbon odor.      Soil samples were collected from the bottom of the excavation at approximately 8 feet bgs and one water sample was collected from groundwater in the excavation.  The floor of the tank excavation appeared to be sandy clay.  Soil sample analysis detected up to 290 parts per million (ppm) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), 210 ppm Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), and 1,800 ppm Total Oil and Grease (TOG).  Grab groundwater sample analysis detected 190 parts per billion (ppb) TPHg, 100,000 ppb TPHd, and 41,000 ppb TOG.  Four discrete stockpile samples detected 38 ppm TPHg, 2.5 ppm TPHd, 10 ppm TOG.  The UST excavation was not overexcavated and the stockpiled pea gravel was used to backfill the excavation.    A soil and groundwater investigation was performed on February 14 and 15, 2008.   Nine soil borings were advanced to depths between 3 and 35 bgs.  Six borings were placed at the four sides of the former UST excavation and three step-out borings were placed between the former UST excavation and the Oakland Estuary Twenty soil samples were collected, the shallowest sample at a depth of 10 feet and the deepest sample at 35 feet bgs.  Six grab groundwater samples were collected from four temporary monitoring wells located on four sides of the former UST excavation. Soil sample analysis detected concentrations up to 5.3 ppm TPHg, 5,000 ppm TPHd, and 4,700 ppm TOG, 5.1 ppm naphthalene, 5.1 ppm arsenic, and 290 ppm lead.  Groundwater sample analysis detected concentrations up to 79 ppb TPHg, 1,200 ppb TPHd, and 1.9 ppb TOG, 550 ppb chromium, and 67 ppb lead.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "UST 97-E is located in the southeastern part of NAS Alameda. It was a 100,000-gallon aviation gasoline tank within CAA 3C. CAA 3 is an approximately 8-acre site that is located in the eastern portion of Alameda Point. The area was originally tidal flats, but it was filled and developed by the end of World War II. CAA 3 is subdivided into three areas designated as CAAs 3A, 3B, and 3C. The landscape island of CAA 3C was a former fuel storage area that consisted of five 100,000-gallon aviation gasoline storage tanks, of which UST 97-E is one. Based on inventory reconciliation records, the Navy estimated 365,000 gallons of fuel may have been released from the fuel storage area during the 1960s and early 1970s. Additionally, an undetermined amount of fuel leaked from fuel lines connecting the aviation gasoline tanks in CAA 3C to the fuel dispensing facilities in CAA 3B.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Six wells (B-1 to B-6) were installed in January 1982 due to an apparent leak of 30 gallons of gasoline.  No soil or groundwater samples were collected; sheen was noted.  All USTs were replaced in 1982; one or more USTs were noted with gauge stick holes.  Well B-2 was destroyed, well B-1 was paved over and could not be located, and wells A-1 and A-2 were installed in the tank backfill at that time.  In September 1991 1,400 gallons of diesel were pumped inadvertently into well A-1.  Between September and December 1991 approximately 1,888 gallons of product were recovered.  Analysis indicated that it was 95.9% lube oil, 2.5% diesel, and 1.6% gasoline, suggesting waste oil had also been inadvertently disposed of in well A-1.  Wells B-7 to B-9 were installed in March 1993.  In April 1994 wells B-3, B-4, and A-2 were decommissioned to allow installation of new product piping.  In April 1994 a 1,000-gallon waste oil UST was removed, and on May 18, 1994 a 350-gallon waste oil UST was removed.  Approximately 700 cubic yards of soil was removed from these excavations.  In October 1995 wells B-10 to B-13 were installed.  In May 2001 soil bores SB-1 to SB-8 were installed.  Wells B-14 and B-15, and soil bore SB-12 were installed in August 2002.  In December 2005 soil bores SB-15 to SB-18 were installed.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently occupied by three large commercial buildings, which are used for office, retail, and storage space, and identified as Park Street Landing at 2307-2337 Blanding Avenue.  From at least 1930 until approximately 1961, the northwestern portion of the site was occupied by a petroleum bulk plant operated by Signal Oil &amp; Gas Company. Former bulk plant facilities consisted of one large and seven smaller gasoline aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) within concrete secondary containment, underground piping, an officice building.  Between 1957 and 1963, the buildings at the site were reportedly removed; it is assumed that the ASTs and piping were also removed at this time. In a 1965 aerial photograph, all the bulk plant facilities appear to have been removed and the majority of the site appears occupied by a construction materials yard with several small structures. Several additional structures also appear present in the southeast portion of the site. From 1973 to 1983, the northwestern portion of the site reportedly was used as a construction yard and for boat repair activities; and the southeastern portion was occupied by a restaurant, paved parking area, and a possible automobile sales lot. In 1987, the site was redeveloped with the current configuration.  e building, a  loading rack, and a small structure containing gasoline pumps.      In February 1995, a soil and groundwater investigation conducted at the site detected petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater.  Various site investigations were conducted between 1998 and 2012.  A Draft Corrective Action Plan that recommended completion of a tidal survey was submited in August 2011.  ACEH concurred with conducting the tidal survey but did not concur with the Draft Corrective Action Plan.  The tidal survey has been completed and the results are currently under review.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    At the time of case closure, the site is a 7,000-square-foot parcel located on the southeastern corner of the intersection of Webster Street and Buena Vista Avenue in the City and County of Alameda, California.  The site is developed with a single-story commercial building occupied by a Circle-K convenience store, and an operating 76 gasoline service station, a concrete paved parking area, and minor landscaping along the eastern side and northwest corner of the parcel.  Adjacent to the property on the east side are residences, across Buena Vista Avenue to the north is an operating Chevron gas station and commercial properties are located south and west of the site.  According to the Assessor’s Office Property Value System and Sanborne Maps, this site has historically been used as a commercial fueling station since at least 1948.    On September 6, 2013, one 1,000-gallon waste oil underground storage tank (UST) was removed from the subject site.  Two soil samples were collected beneath the UST, and one stockpile, and one grab groundwater sample were also collected.  Concentrations up to 30.9 mg\/kg TPHd and 213 mg\/kg TPHmo were detected in soil, and concentrations up to 18,200 micrograms per liter (µg\/l) TPHd and 46,200 µg\/l TPHmo were detected in groundwater.  Additional contaminants were also detected.  These data indicate than an unauthorized release had occurred.    This case was originally opened by ACDEH after a property transaction (BP to United Brothers) and the discovery of the diesel and waste oil Light Non Aqueous Liquids (LNAPL; per the LTCP definition) at the former waste oil UST in the southwestern corner of the site, as well as the discovery of  diesel LNAPL in the northwest corner of the site that appears related to the conversion of a former gasoline UST to a diesel UST (converted after an ownership change).  At the time of opening of this case ACDEH closed the former case (RO0000281; T0600101651) as it appeared to be gasoline only. In December 2016, ACDEH per the direction of the USTCF separated the diesel release (associated with the gasoline tank conversion in 2009) by opening a new Case No. RO0003235 from the waste oil release.    Site investigation activities related to the waste oil release were conducted between 2013 and 2018 to evaluate the extent of subsurface contamination to soil, soil gas, and groundwater from the 1,000-gallon waste oil tank discovered during the September 6, 2013 tank removal from the southwest corner of the site.  Site investigations included obtaining tank excavation confirmation soil and groundwater samples, installation of six onsite soil bores (SB-1 to SB-6) for soil and grab groundwater sampling, installation of one offsite soil bore (SB-7) for the collection of offsite soil and grab groundwater samples, and the installation of three soil vapor points (SV-1, SV-2 &amp; SV-3) along the east side of the service station to assess vapor risk to the adjacent residence.  In addition, two replacement groundwater monitoring wells MW-2A and MW-3A were installed to replace monitoring wells MW-2 and MW-3 that were damaged beyond repair during site renovation.    Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were also detected in groundwater and soil vapor at concentrations at or slightly above the 2019 ESLs.  It is uncertain if the initial vapor concentrations are representative of the range of potential vapor concentrations.  For this reason, a separate SCP case has been opened (RO0003272, T10000013083) for oversight of VOCs at the site.    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP).    The site meets all eight General Critiera, the Groundwater  Media-Specific Criteria, is exempt from the Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air Criteria onsite because it is an active service station, but the eastern margin of the property was also evaluated against the Residential Scenario in the Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air Criteria due to the presence of a residential house and neighborhood to the east, and meets the Residential Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air Media Specific Criteria on the eastern property margin of the subject site.  The site also meets the Commercial and Industrial Direct Contact Media-Specific Criteria.  The site does not meet the Residential Direct Contact Media-Specific Criteria due to non-detectable PAHs above residential PAH Direct Contact values.    Under the current land use, except for limited areas along the eastern property margin and several additional minor landscaped areas, the site is entirely paved resulting in a low potential for direct contact exposure under the current land use as a city street.  Due to residual contamination at the site associated with the former waste oil UST, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party, prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    Based on the information in the case file, and with the provision that the information provided to ACDEH is accurate and representative of site conditions, this case has been closed.  A 60-day public notification period was completed on 4\/5\/2019.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In September 1975 three USTs were removed and station structures were demolished in October 1978: however, no confirmation sampling was completed at the time of UST removal. In Early 1980 the property was redeveloped and a residential duplex was constructed at the site. A preliminary site assessment was completed in June 1997 and eight soil borings were installed . Soil and groundwater samples collected during the investigation detected elevated concentrations of TPHg and benzene beneath the site. In November 1998 groundwater monitoring wells were installed to evaluate the dissolved phase plume. HIgh concentrations of dissolved phase petroleum hydrocarbons were detected. A FS\/CAP was prepared in September 2009 to evaluate remedial alternative to clean up soil and groundwater beneath the site.  CAP submitted August 2010; excavation was chosen; ACEH approved CAP September 2010; CAP delayed due to high groundwater &amp; revised CAP implementation schedule submitted Janaury 2011.    No soil samples collected in the 0 to 5 foot below ground surface interval. Therefore, the requisite samples have not been collected to demonstrate compliance with the LTCP Media Specific Criteira for Direct Contact and Outdoor Air. However, impacted soil has been largely removed with the possible exception of soil beneath the northwestern corner of the current apartment building located in the vicinity of the former canopy.    Soil vapor samples collected at 5 five feet bgs are below the threshold criteria for the LTCP Media Specific Criteria for Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air. However, although no data has been provided on the depth of the building foundations to verify that the samples were collected at least 5 feet below the bottom of the building foundation (as required by the LTCP), vapor intrusion to indoor air is considered low risk due to the lack of volatiles in soil and groundwater at the site. Additionally, although the tubing used in the probe construction is known to absorb naphthalene and is not recommended for use with naphthalene soil gas sample collection per the 2012 DTSC Active Soil Gas Investgations Advisory, the detected naphthalene cncentrations in soil gas at the site are approximatley 60 percent below the LTCP screening levels, and naphthalene has not been detected in soil and groundwater at concentrations of concern.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This Fuel Leak Case RO0002601 was opened by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health to investigate a release reported during a UST removal in 2004. A separate Site Cleanup Program Case #01S0055 is being overseen by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board for non-petroleum UST contamination associated with historic site use. The site was recently repurposed and is currently used as a concrete products design and fabrication facility. The former tank and fuel dispenser areas are located in the open air bays in the yard.     In January 2004 a 2,000 gallon gasoline UST, dispenser island and associated piping was removed and confirmation soil and groundwater samples collected. The tank was a single-walled steel tank covered with tar paper. The tank was observed to be in good condition. A grab groundwater sample collected from the tank pit had a TPH-g concentration of 8600 ug\/L, 570 ug\/L benzene, 150 ug\/L ethylbenzene, 400 ug\/L xylenes and less than 1.7 ug\/L  MTBE. Soil confirmation samples collected from the tank pit had maximum concentrations of  6400 mg\/kg of TPH-g, 6.4 mg\/kg benzene, 7.4 mg\/kg ethylbenzne, less than 1 mg\/kg toluene, 8.6 mg\/kg xylenes and less than 0.1 MTBE. No overexcavation was performed.     There are two water bearing zones at the site and groundwater in both appear to be tidally influenced. Three shallow groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1, MW-2 and MW-3) were installed in 2010 in the vicinity of the tank pit, dispenser island and downgradient adjacent to the estuary. A nested pair of wells (MW-4A and  MW-4B) were installed in 2015 in a location down to cross gradient of the release along the estuary bank. Ten groundwater monitoring events have been conducted in MW-1 through MW-3 between 2010 and 2015. Two groundwater monitoring events have been conducted in wells MW-4.A and MW-4B in 2015. The downgradient wells (MW-3 and MW-4A and MW-4B located along the estuary banks have had non-detect levels of petroleum hydrocarbons in all groundwater samples. Samples collected from MW-1 and MW-2 since 2012 have not had concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons above the laboratory detection limits.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0003430 was opened by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) in May 2020 to provide regulatory oversight of the investigation and cleanup of subsurface contamination at the Site to facilitate redevelopment by Alameda Marina  LLC.     The Alameda Marina project will repurpose the existing maritime facility located on approximately 44 acres on the Alameda waterfront.  The Master Plan community will create four separate parcels and a total of 760 residential units, +\/- 125,000 square feet of new maritime\/commercial space, improvements to the 529-slip marina, and 3.6 acres of park space.    Site development consists of four proposed phases that are to occur over several years. The first to occur is the Wrap A development in the Phase 1A area located on APN 71-257-3-1 located at 2021 Clement Ave. #A-C and APN 71-288-1-2 located at 1829 Clement Ave. #200.  The Wrap A development will consist of primarily residential units and parking. In subsequent years, the Phase 1B, Phase II, and then Phase III areas of the Site will be developed. A final map will be recorded in late 2020 that will split the Site into four separate parcels corresponding with each phase of development.  Upon recipient of documentation that the parcel split has been finalized, ACDEH will open sperate environmental cleanup cases for each parcel.      The approximately trapezoidal-shaped Phase 1A area consists of approximately 6 acres of land and is bounded by Clement Avenue to the south, Alameda Marina Drive to the west, the inner harbor of the Oakland estuary to the north, and Phase 1B of the planned development at the Site to the east, which will include an extension of Schiller Street. The Wrap A (subject Site) development in the Phase 1A area of the Site is approximately rectangular-shaped and consists of approximately 4 acres of land.    Environmental investigations were conducted without ACDEH oversight from 2013 to early 2020 at which time ACDEH entered into a VRAA with Alameda Marina LLC .  Results from these investigations document constituents of concern (COCs) in soil, groundwater, and soil vapor samples associated with historic land-use.  COC identified during these investigations include diesel– and motor oil-range total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH-d and TPH mo), metals including lead and vanadium, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including benzene and ethylbenzene, naphthalene at concentrations above California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Bay Area Region Tier 1 Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs). Environmental conditions within the Wrap A appear similar to those mentioned above, with the exception of impacts related to a former manufactured gas holder. During demolition and geotechnical excavation activities performed beginning in August 2020, the remnants of one of the former gas holders were identified and a layer of black, tarry material, often associated with such features, was found just below the ground surface within and near the gas holder. Assessment of the extent of material is currently in progress and the impacted material will be removed and disposed of off-site under ACDEH oversight    Since ACDEH began environmental oversight in May 2020, that have been weekly conference calls conducted with the RP and their environmental consultants to discuss subsurface investigations and implementation of adequate controls and mitigation measures to protect onsite workers and the surrounding community, including real-time dust monitoring with dedicated environmental professional, increased dust suppression measures, revised truck decontamination and route procedures, and direct-load requirements.  ACDEH has allowed Alameda Marina, LLC to proceed with the remaining demolition activities at Wrap A previous approved by the City of Alameda in December 2019, conduct subsurface investigation activities in Wrap A, and conducted limited subsurface investigation for a Archaeological investigation provided that a dedicated environmental professional observe all sub-surface disturbance activities and strict community protection are implemented as outlined in the ACDEH-approved Soil and Groundwater Management Plan (SGMP) and SGMP Addendum.    Documentation of additional subsurface investigations conducted in the Wrap A area will be uploaded as they are completed.",

CAA 3 is an approximately 8-acre site that is located in the eastern portion of Alameda Point. The area was originally tidal flats, but it was filled and developed by the end of World War II. CAA 3 is subdivided into three areas designated as CAAs 3A, 3B, and 3C. The landscape island of CAA 3C was a former fuel storage area that consisted of five 100,000-gallon aviation gasoline storage tanks, of which UST 97-B is one. Based on inventory reconciliation records, the Navy estimated 365,000 gallons of fuel may have been released from the fuel storage area during the 1960s and early 1970s. Additionally, an undetermined amount of fuel leaked from fuel lines connecting the aviation gasoline tanks in CAA 3C to the fuel dispensing facilities in CAA 3B.",

To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial\/industrial configurations such as shipping building, painting and machine shops.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media including soil.  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include remediation soil excavation and off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site is part of a larger 26 acre mixed use residential and commercial maritime develop.  Development of this property will construction of 31 3-story townhomes with a total of 182 units.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This CAA Site was created in Geotracker to represent a corrective action area (CAA) that may contain numerous Individual Sites associated with appurtenant piping, USTs, AGTs, OWS, etc..  Contamination present within the larger CAA Site may be co-mingled with the smaller Individual Sites. So, while all Individual Sites may be closed, the CAA Site may still remain open with residual contamination not associated with the Individual Sites located within the CAA.    CAA 3 is an approximately 8-acre site that is located in the eastern portion of Alameda Point. The area was originally tidal flats, but it was filled and developed by the end of World War II. CAA 3 is subdivided into three areas designated as CAAs 3A, 3B, and 3C. Currently, Building 398 at CAA 3A is occupied by tenants who operate an engine testing facility and an electronics recycling business. CAA 3B is primarily paved open space, and CAA 3C includes the westbound portion of Atlantic Avenue and a landscaped island at the main east entrance to Alameda Point.Petroleum fuel releases occurred at each of the CAAs. At CAA 3A, jet fuel propellant no. 5 (jet fuel) was reported to have been released from two underground storage tanks adjacent to Building 398. The landscape island of CAA 3C was a former fuel storage area that consisted of five 100,000-gallon aviation gasoline storage tanks. Based on inventory reconciliation records, the Navy estimated 365,000 gallons of fuel may have been released from the fuel storage area during the 1960s and early 1970s. Additionally, an undetermined amount of fuel leaked from fuel lines connecting the aviation gasoline tanks in CAA 3C to the fuel dispensing facilities in CAA 3B.",

The elevated PAHs found in both soil  samples from this location are not attributed to a fuel release, and they were not further investigated during the Supplemental Data Gap Investigation study. Shallow soil at the USTs 37-5 to 37-9 site is adequately characterized; however, the source and extent of elevated PAHs at this site, particularly at UST37-08-SB01, should be evaluated.

USTs 547-4 and 547-5 were stainless steel waste oil tanks , one with a 5,000-gallon capacity, the other 10,000. A UST Unauthorized Release Report was filed on 2\/10\/1995 regarding an unknown volume of gasoline released during tank removal.  Three 12,000 gallon gasoline tanks installed at service station in 1971, operated until 1980, filed 2\/10\/1995.   Dual Phase Extraction (DPE) removed 52,755 pounds hydrocarbons as of December 2006.  Groundwater was sampled in 2011 and 2012 and the February 2013 report indicates that groundwater monitoring and additional corrective action is being conducted, with AS\/SVE cleanup action from 4\/15\/13 to 12\/15\/13.       CoC is gasoline, the waste oil at this location is covered under another case which addresses the former waste oil USTs.",

Concentrations of petroleum fractions above PRCs were not detected in the Data Gap Investigation soil samples from the site. However, testing of groundwater showed ESL exceedances for petroleum fractions both at the west end of the tank cluster and down hydraulic gradient to the west and southwest. The evidence of hydrocarbons reported in borings in the southwestern part of the site warrants additional investigation. Two abandoned 6-inch diameter gasoline lines ran southeast from Ferry Point to a piping network east of the USTs. Borings UST37-13-SB15 and  UST37-13-SB16 appear to be located in close proximity to these former abandoned gasoline lines. The possibility exists that dissolved hydrocarbons were released from the former tanks or  related fuel lines in the immediate area. No additional investigation of the USTs is warranted at this time, but an investigation of the former fuel piping should be conducted to evaluate potential  fuel piping releases in the vicinity of these former USTs.",

These two tanks were removed by PWC in June 1995.    The few exceedances of TPH fractions observed in soil and groundwater about USTs 37-21 and 37-22 suggest that little residual hydrocarbons remain in soil and groundwater about these  former tanks. The only elevated middle distillate hydrocarbons in soil were observed in boring UST37-21-SB16 that was positioned approximately 20 feet upgradient of the USTs. The  hydrocarbons detected at this location may have originated from a fuel line release, and may not be associated with the former USTs. The only ESL or PRC exceedances observed in  groundwater were PAHs in the sample from the backfilled footprint of tank 37-22 (boring UST37-17-SB04). The elevated PAHs were not associated with elevated TPH fractions,suggesting a possible alternate source. No additional investigation of the USTs is warranted at this time.

The tanks were removed in July 1995.    The only ESL exceedances for dissolved TPH fractions were observed downgradient of former UST 37-24 (UST37-21-SB09A), which is in the area of former fuel piping.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "CAA-4B includes Building 372, USTs 372-1 and 372-2, and AST 372. Building 372 was a turbo propeller test cell built in 1953 and used for engine testing. Aircraft oil was stored in the building and minor leaks were reported. The building is currently a vacant structure with asphalt and concrete paved areas that are occasionally used for parking. UST 372-1 had a capacity of 1,000 gallon gallons and stored jet fuel; UST 372-2 had a reported capacity of 1,000 gallons and stored lubricating oil; and AST 372 had an unknown capacity and stored oil.  UST 372-1 was removed in April 1995 and UST 372-2 was removed in December 1998. AST 372 is presumed to have been removed and disposed of offsite prior to 2002. During removal of  USTs 372-1 and 372-2 in April 1995, free product was observed in both excavations. AST 372 included a secondary containment with a concrete berm and was presumed to have been removed and disposed prior to 2002; however no record is available.     Soil and groundwater analytical data collected prior to and at the time of UST removal in 1995 indicated that a localized fuel oil release had likely occurred and soil with elevated benzene (5.8 milligrams per kilogram [mg\/kg]) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline (7,100 mg\/kg), diesel (4,900 mg\/kg), and jet fuel (5,400 mg\/kg) in soil (Battelle 2012). Elevated benzene (2,768 micrograms per liter [μg\/L]), TPG-gasoline (1,000,000 μg\/L), and TPH-diesel (7,000,000 μg\/L) were detected in Site groundwater prior to UST removal.   Approximately 2,000 gallons of free product were removed via a product recovery well between 1995 and 1998. Groundwater monitoring activities were conducted from 1997 through 2008.    Land Use Controls, Excavation for Soil, and In-Situ Chemical Treatment for Groundwater is proposed as the most appropriate remedial action for CAA-4B. The remedial design was completed in August 2020 and corrective action implementation is planned for 2021.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Alcan Aluminum Corporation (Alcan) operated a plant that produced aluminum products. Alcan ceased operations at the site in 1984. The Wilanco, Inc property has historically been used for industrial operations, primarily diesel engine servicing and sales. The SPTCo right-of-way is no longer in service.     Site investigations performed by others identified two distinctly different types of petroleum hydrocarbon impacts to site soil. Mineral spirit compounds were identified in the eastern portion of the Alcan plant area, and a mixture of petroleum products termed \"black ooze\" was identified in the western portion of the Site.    In 1991, Alcan contracted O'Brien &amp; Gere, Inc., to implement a bioremediation treatment program in the area east of the existing sheet pile wall. This program was implemented to address mineral spirit compounds in soil.    Site assessment performed by O'Brian &amp; Gere identified the bay mud overlying the Merrit sand as a unit of low hydraulic conductivity. Laboratory analysis performed as part of O'Brian &amp; Gere's site assessment indicated that the vertical hydraulic conductivity of bay mud at the site is less than 1 x 10^-7 centimeters per second.    Results of site investigations performed by ENSR Consulting &amp; Engineering indicated that the EBMUD sewer line has potentially acted as a hydraulic barrier to westward migration of the black ooze petroleum product located west of the existing sheetpile barrier wall.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is an active retail gasoline station and mini-mart. In August 1989, Applied GeoSystems performed a limited environmental assessment at the site. Five borings (B-1 through B-5) were advanced in the vicinity of the existing gasoline USTs to evaluate potential hydrocarbon impacts to soil prior to removing and replacing the USTs.  In June 1991, RESNA Environmental advanced two soil borings (B-6 and B-7) in the area of a proposed new UST complex to evaluate for potential hydrocarbon impacts in soil. In July 1991, four USTs were removed from the site.  Several of the tanks were reported to have visible holes. Based on elevated levels of total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) in soil, 350 cubic yards of hydrocarbon impacted soil was over-excavated from the tank pit and disposed of off-site. In October 1991, RESNA installed four groundwater monitoring wells (RW-1, MW-1, MW-2, and MW-3) to further evaluate the extent of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater. In November 1991, RESNA conducted a step-drawdown test in well RW-1. In August 1992, RESNA advanced eight soil borings (B-12 through B-19). Six of the borings (B-14 through B-19) were converted into soil vapor extration (SVE) wells. Borings B-12 and B-13 were advanced in the vicinity of the former waste oil tank to  evalaute impacts to soil from waste oil. In August 1992 RESNA performe an SVE pilot test to evaluate the feasibility of SVE as a remedial option. In November 1992, RESNA installed two additional onsite groundwater monitoring wells (MW-4 and MW-5) and an offsite well MW-6 to evaluate dissolved phase gasoline constituents in the down-gradient groundwater flow direction. In June 1993, RESNA installed three SVE wells (VW-7 through VW-9) and two air sparge\/SVE wells (AS-1 and AS-2). In August 1993, RESNA performed an AS\/SVE pilot test to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing air sparging in conjunciton with SVE. In November 1993 a groundwater extration system (GWE) was installed using existing extraction well RW-1, and an AS\/SVE remediation system was installed using existing SVE wells (VW-7 through VW-9) and six new SVE wells (VW-1 through VW-6) and existing AS well (AS-1 and AS-2).  The AS\/SVE system operated intermittently from December 1993 through February 2004 when it was shut down due to low influent concentrations. The GWE System reportedly never operated. In March 2009, Broadbent &amp; Associates (BAI) installed three monitoring wells (MW-7 through MW-9) to evaluate the remedial effectiveness of the AS\/SVE system. In March 2011, BAI conducted a soil vapor intrusion assessment in the vicinity of the onsite building to evaluate the potential for benzene vapr intrusion. The vapor intrusion assessment was conducted prior to implementation of the Low Threat UST Closure Policy in August 2012. Consequently, since the site is an active commerical fueling station it is exempt from the media specific criteria for vapor intrusion unless there are off-site impacts.    The site was evaluated for case closure under the State Water Resources Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy and was closed on May 20, 2014.  Based upon the information available in our files to date, no further investigation or cleanup for the fuel leak case is necessary at this time.      Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Two USTs were removed in April 1998 (1,000-gallon diesel, and 10,000-gallon gasoline).  UST removal confirmation samples contained trace concentrations of TPHd, TPHg, and BTEX\/M compounds; however, groundwater contained concentrations of gasoline and BTEX\/M compounds at levels of concern.  Two hand augured soil bores were installed in the presumed downgradient direction from the gasoline UST in January 1999.  Trace concentrations were encountered in soil; however, MTBE was detected in one grab groundwater sample.  In March 1999 an additional bore was proposed to be installed further downgradient (presumed) to investigate the extent of MTBE contamination; the work was also approved in March 1999.  This work is not been documented to have occurred.  In October 2013 two additional soil bores (IB-3 and IB-4) were installed to define the extent of gasoline groundwater contamination at the site.

In November 1990 three USTs were removed and in January 1991 the excavation was enlarged.  In February 1991 bores STMW-1 and STMW-2 were installed.  In November 1996 wells STMW-3 and STMW-4 were installed.  In May 2002 bores B-1 to B-6 were installed.  Beginning in 2003 HVOCs became a concern at the site; a dry cleaner is also present at the site.  In October 2006 bores GP-1 to GP-4 and CPT-1 to CPT-3 were installed.  In August 2007 well STMW-6 was installed.  Creek surface water sampling ceased in December 2007.  In February 2009 well STMW-7 and bores B-7 and B-8 were installed.  Also in February 2009 10 vapor points (VP-1 to VP-10) were installed and sampled.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case are available on GeoTracker.

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    As part of a property transaction a site investigation was conducted and discovered a concentration of 1.1 mg\/kg tetrachlorethene (PCE) and 0.0059 mg\/kg Trichloroethene (TCE) in soil beneath the site.  Five soil bores were installed to collect soil and groundwater samples.  In April 2006 four soil gas probes were installed at a depth of 5 feet bgs.    Additional investigation resumed in January 2013, and included multiple rounds of investigation and corrective actions at the site (1181, 1183, 1185, 1187 and 1191 Solano Avenue), and also included investigations at offsite properties.  Ultimately approximately 618.5 tons of contaminated soil was excavated and disposed of offsite.    In summary, soil at the site was contaminated by a release of tetrachloroethene or PCE from a former dry cleaning facility that operated as Albany 1-Hr Cleaners at 1187 Solano Avenue.  These operations resulted in contamination of soil, soil gas, and groundwater with organic chemicals including tetrachloroethene, trichloroethene, and cis-1,2-dichloroethene, which constitute hazardous materials as that term is defined in Health &amp; Safety Code Section 25260.  The organic contamination has been extensively remediated using soil excavation.  It appears that soil contamination has been removed to below residential RWQCB ESL screening values.  The groundwater contamination has been remediated and\/or attenuated to below applicable screening levels, except for one limited area near well MW-3, but which also appears to be decreasing.  Subslab gas Chemicals of Concern (COC) concentrations exceed RWQCB ESL screening levels on the property at select locations. Engineering controls to mitigate potential exposure include passive subslab ventilation systems at 1183, 1185, 1187 and 1191 Solano Avenue, and a chemical-resistant vapor barrier at 1187 Solano Avenue.  The subslab ventilation systems at 1185, 1187 and 1191 Solano Avenue can be activated in the future if necessary.  Institutional controls include a deed restriction and a Site Management Plan that will remain on file with the County and the City of Albany Building Department to safeguard human health from exposure during any future redevelopment or construction, and to flag building applications for future modifications to foundations and ACEH review.  A summary of subsurface conditions and mitigation measures at sites overlying the groundwater plume is presented in closure documents.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Case closure is granted for the current commercial land use.    Due to residual subsurface contamination remaining at the site, if any redevelopment occurs, or if a change in land use to residential, or other conservative land use, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.    Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    This site is to be entered into the City of Albany Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.    Current Land-use at time of Closure    The subject site consists of two commercial buildings occupied by Kelly Moore Paint store and Cosmo Prof in a commercial district at the intersection of San Pablo Avenue and Buchanan Street, in Albany California.  The area to the north, west, and south is commercial, while land to the east is residential.  The offices of the City of Albany are across the street to the southwest of the site.    Due to residual subsurface contamination remaining at the site, if any redevelopment occurs, or if a change in land use to residential, or other conservative land use, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.    Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    Adjacent Property(ies) Land-use at Time of Closure    The area to the north, west, and south is commercial, while land to the east is residential.  Groundwater with concentrations of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) derived from the former waste oil UST at the subject site impact offsite groundwater to the southwest.    Historic Land-use \/ Site Investigation    The site was formerly a Firestone store, with a 500-gallon waste oil UST and five in-ground hydraulic lifts.  The waste oil UST was removed in May 1990.  Concentrations of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), oil and grease, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and total xylenes (BTEX), tetrachloroethene (PCE), 1,2-Dichloroetheane, and other chemicals of concern were detected.  Four groundwater wells MW-1 to MW-4 were installed in September 1990.  Well MW-1 was subsequently destroyed during a waste oil remedial overexcavation conducted in October 1990.  The hydraulic lifts were removed in September 1998 with some additional overexcavation to reduce hydraulic oil concentrations at their former locations.  Groundwater monitoring occurred intermittently between April 1998 and February 2015, and a soil vapor investigation was conducted in 2012.  Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern    Earlier in site investigations Chemicals of Concern (COCs) at the site included TPHd, TPH as gasoline (TPHg), BTEX, and oil and grease.  These COCs were eliminated after approximately May 1999.  Chlorinated VOCs, including PCE, Trichloroethene (TCE), 1,2-DCA, and vinyl chloride (VC) were identified early in site investigations, and remained as COCs at the site after the elimination of petroleum hydrocarbons as COC.    Potential exposure routes for these chemicals included the potential for vapor intrusion and direct contact exposure.     Remediation Activities    A remedial overexcavation of the waste oil UST was conducted in October 1990, and the hydraulic lifts were removed and limited overexcavation was conducted in September 1998.  Case Closure &amp; Future Site Management Requirements     This waste oil UST release case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.    In addition, the release included chlorinated solvents.  Although the chemicals released at the site are predominately not chlorinated solvents the case has also been evaluated consistent with criteria described in the Regional Water Board’s Assessment Tool for Closure of Low-Threat Chlorinated Solvents, as they are relevant and appropriate for evaluating closure.  Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.

Remedial excavations were conducted in October and November 2013, and three monitoring wells were subsequently installed to monitor and sample groundwater in order to determine if the remedial overexcavation successfully removed associated contamination.  An historic rail line, and historic fill and associated contamination, was encountered during the excavations and both were subsequently removed to the limits of the property.  Limited residual contamination above identified remedial goals is present and a Site Management Plan has been generated in order to manage subsurface incursions, and the generation of contaminated soil or groundwater, in the future at the site.

Soil and groundwater beneath the site have been contaminated by fuel hydrocarbons that leaked from the underground storage tank system.  A plume of contaminated groundwater containing dissolved fuel hydrocarbons and the fuel oxygenate MTBE has migrated from the service station more than 100 feet to the north.  Groundwater contamination also extends off-site to the south and west.  Based on the site conditions, the off-site groundwater contamination does not exceed levels that would pose a potential health risk for indoor air intrusion to residences or commercial buildings.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.",

Commercial\/industrial activity at this site spans approximately 100 years.  Corrective actions implemented to remove impacted soil.  Added observation well in excavation area and added oxygen releasing material to soil\/groundwater interface to enhance petroleum degradation in groundwater.  Fourth quarter monitoring results due in July 2013.  Continued improvement of groundwater suggests corrective action completion has met goals and should be considered for no further action.",

ACDEH initially assumed the lead agency role and opened two Site Cleanup Program (SCP) cases for the investigation and cleanup of subsurface contamination from historic operations at the former Pacific Steel Casting Company. SCP Case No. RO0003370 was opened for the portion of Plant 2 that operated on leased property at 1433 Eastshore Highway currently owned by HFR Properties. This case (SCP Case No. RO0003371 Former Pacific Steel Casting Company - Berkeley Properties, LLC) was opened for the remainder of the facility that operated on property formerly owned by Pacific Steel Casting Company, LLC and now owned by Berkeley Properties LLC.    In August 2016 ACDEH referred the two environmental cleanup cases to the State for oversight and in October 2019 the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) assumed lead regulatory oversight.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is located on the Dwight Place grounds at 1812 Dwight Way in the City of Berkeley, California. In 1985, the property was undergoing redevelopment from light industrial to multi-family residential. A new subdivision for multi-family dwellings was constructed on the eastern portion of the site and was separated from the older, existing structure on the western end of the site which is used as a ballet studio. The site is at an approximate elevation of 120 feet (MSL). The topography of the site area is gently sloping towards the southwest with a slope of approximately 50:1 (horizontal to vertical). Natural drainage of the site area is towards the southwest into San Francisco Bay. The surface drainage of the site is generally by sheet flow towards the west into a storm drainage collection system.    Historically, we understand that the subject site was used as a linen service but was vacant for an estimated seven years prior to the present redevelopment. During the course of the redevelopment of the site, two underground solvent storage tanks on Grant Street and two underground petroleum fuel tanks (one on Grant Street and one on Dwight Way) were identified and removed with regulatory oversight by the City of Berkeley in conjunction with the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board. These tanks were unused during the period of current ownership (7 years) and were estimated to be at least 30 years old. City records show the tanks were in installed in 1955 and 1963. Sampling in 1985 underneath the former solvent tanks for volatile organic compounds in soil and groundwater did not detect any chemical concentrations at levels of concern. In June 1986, Tank contents of the two underground petroleum fuel storage tanks were tested for identification purposes and found the following:. Contents of Tank 1 on Dwight Street were identified as primarily light hydrocarbon; and contents of Tank 2 on Grant Street were identified as primarily heavy hydrocarbons. All removal of tanks, pipelines, impacted soil and water from excavations and utility trenches were completed by September 1986. (refer to report by Applied Earth Consultants dated 10\/31\/1986 titled \"Subsurface Investigation and Testing - Dwight Place\"). Wells (2) were sealed in October 2020. The Regional Water Quality Control Board closed this case (#01-1620) and the associated case (#01S0048) December 21, 2020.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "6,000-gal underground single walled tank was removed in October 1990. The UST consisted of two compartments: one contained ethyl alcohol, the other propanol. Soil samples contained small amounts of DCA and TCA; no petroleum hydrocarbons detected. A groundwater sample collected rom the excavation contained up to 19 ug\/l of TCE, 5,000 ug\/l of TCA, and other VOCs. The groundwater was pumped out prior to backfilling the excavation. A soil and GW investigation conducted in June 1992 included installation of 3 monitoring wells. Only one soil sample contained 160,000 ug\/l acetone. The source of the acetone was unknown. GW samples from the MWs revealed chlorinated solvent contamination and some TPH contamination in all wells. Two additional MWs installed in 1993 (one off-site); four soil borings advanced as well. TCE was reported in the grab water sample from B-4 up to 2,800 ug\/l. The review of the environmental data for the neighboring properties may suggest that there are other additional off-site sources of the VOCs not associated w\/the former Emerald Packaging onsite operations. Site Closure Summary dated July 17, 1999 approved by the Berkeley TMD and  NFA letter from the Water Board dated October 19, 2000.",

The hospital is bounded by Ashby Avenue, Regent Street, Colby Street in Berkeley,  In 1987 a 1,000 gallon diesel spill occurred from piping connected to two 10,000-gallon diesel Underground storage tanks (USTs) used for standby generators. Diesel was found in utility corridors, cracks within the foundation, sand traps, trenches, as documented in the reports from 1987-1988. Several years later, during excavation for construction of a new loading ramp at the medical center (along Regent Street) soil containing petroleum hydrocarbons was encountered on Jan 19, 1994. Over 500 cubic yards of diesel contaminated soil was removed from the Site. No MTBE or BTEX was found in any soil or groundwater samples analyzed. Investigation and cleanup actions were conducted in cooperation with City of Berkeley Toxics Management Program until June 2013 when the case was referred to the Regional Water Quality Control Board for oversight. Soil, soil vapor and groundwater investigations and ongoing groundwater monitoring in 2019 confirmed that the case was eligible for low-threat case closure.  A public notification fact sheet was distributed to interested parties, nearby residents and property owners on January 16, 2020.  A Monitoring Well Destruction Completion Report dated April 24, 2020 has been submitted. Case was closed May 22, 2020.",

All primary and secondary source areas—including a chromium sump, a xylene sump, three chromate wastewater underground storage tanks (USTs), associated drain line piping, and contaminated soil—were remediated by excavation. The facility discontinued chemical engraving activity and onsite wastewater treatment in 1993. The facility had been investigated and remediated by 1999. Hexavalent chromium is present in groundwater offsite and is being mitigated by the injection of MRC and natural attenuation. A total of 16 onsite and offsite wells are available for monitoring  the chromium plume. Additional groundwater injections occurred in 2018.    Water board directive issued 2\/26\/2019 required a RAP to evaluate and design remedial actions to prevent skatepark user exposures and remediate the groundwater plume. The RAP submitted in April 2019 did not adequately address the directive.",

In 1967, Airco purchased the property for storage of old equipment, spent dolomite, and neutralized chemical metal etching waste prior to disposal. In 1978, the site was divided into two properties: 2850 7th Street and 729 Heinz Avenue. The Temescal Business Center, a multi-tenant industrial complex, currently occupies the 2850 7th Street site.

Eastshore Park extends from the Emeryville Crescent in the south to Point Isabel in the north, and falls within five different cities (Oakland, Emeryville, Berkeley, Albany, and Richmond).    The acreage was transferred from Catellus Development Co. to the California Department of Parks and Recreation and the East Bay Regional Park District in 1999 following a two-year escrow period, during which the Board oversaw site investigation and cleanup.  Cleanup involved excavation of contaminated shallow soil at 17 locations (total of 4,600 cubic yards) with clean-soil backfill.  This is in addition to a sediment cleanup at Point Isabel in the 1980s which resulted in some lead-impacted soil being managed onsite in the upland portion of the parcel. (http:\/\/www.envirostor.dtsc.ca.gov\/public\/profile_report.asp?global_id=07360034)    Cleanup is regulated by two SCRs – one for Emeryville Crescent and one for the remainder of the park acreage.  The SCRs require active cleanup (completed in 1998) and ongoing risk management (cap maintenance at Point Isabel and shoreline erosion control).

The subject property building is currently occupied by a restaurant called Oscar’s. The subject property is listed in the database summary as a Historic Auto Station under the name of W.R. Morely Shell in the years 1933 and 1943. No other information regarding the service station is provided    Limited Phase II subsurface soil and soil gas sampling was conducted at the subject property in conjunction with the Phase I assessment. The objective of the subsurface investigation was to evaluate whether any residual concentrations of fuel hydrocarbons exist in soil from the former service station land use at the property from the 1930s through the 1950s. With the exception of soil sample S-7-B3 that contained 350 mg\/kg TVHg (total volatile hydrocarbons as gasoline), no soil ESL established for metals or petroleum hydrocarbons were exceeded. The sample S-10-B3 from 10 feet bgs was collected three feet deeper than sample S-7-B3, only contained 16 mg\/kg TVHg, which suggests a rapid attenuation of hydrocarbons with depth. The lack of BTEX (benzene toulene ethylene and xylenes) in soil samples (except for trace amounts) can be attributed to the age of the spill.     Maximum concentrations of on Site soil gas samples reached up to 13,000,000 μg\/m3 TVHg, and soil gas sample SV-2 contained 390,000 μg\/m3 TVHg. Both of these results exceed the ESL of 29,000 μg\/m3 established for gasoline range hydrocarbons in shallow soil in a commercial setting (Water Board, 2008).",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This case meets the low-threat closure criteria in the State Water Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (Policy)  as shown below.    SITE HISTORY:  The Site is a former service station, active from 1964 to 2008 when the Site building was demolished and all facilities removed. The Site is currently a vacant, unpaved, fenced lot. All underground piping and underground storage tanks (USTs) have been removed from the Site. Planned future use for the Site is a hotel. The Site is bound to the west by multiple unit residences. The first generation tanks (two gasoline USTs and one waste oil UST) were replaced in 1986. Contaminated soil was over-excavated and no environmental screening levels (ESLs)  exceedances were identified by confirmation samples collected at a depth of 1 to 2 feet below the tanks. The product dispensers were replaced in 1994. A 520-gallon waste oil tank (WOT) was removed from the Site in November 2003. In May 2008, the Site was decommissioned and the USTs removed. The USTs were reported to be in excellent condition at the time of removal, with no obvious corrosion or broken seams. The UST excavation contained obvious discolorations and a slight petroleum hydrocarbon odor. No separate-phase hydrocarbons were observed in groundwater in the tank pit.    REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES:  Extensive investigations have been conducted at the Site and its vicinity including the installation of at least 34 soil borings, 15 monitoring wells (5 of which are well clusters), and 14 soil vapor probes. In 2009, a large excavation removed soil from most of the Site to a depth of 12 to 16 feet bgs. 5,660 tons of soil were generated and disposed offsite. In 2009, a previously unknown 500-gallon WOT was discovered at the Site.   The WOT was removed. The available evidence indicates that no significant release occurred from the WOT. A soil sample from beneath this WOT following removal was analyzed for TPH-g, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (including benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, xylenes and MtBE), total oil and grease, and the California Title 22 metals.   No elevated concentrations of chemicals of concern were detected in the soil sample. The fuel additives 1,2-Dichloroethane and ethylene dibromide, were tested in soil and groundwater (both before and after the 2009 excavation) and the results were very low or ND concentrations. In addition, groundwater from some of the MWs historically was tested for TPH-motor oil, pesticides\/polychlorinated biphenyls, and metals and no elevated concentrations of concern were detected. Finally, a soil vapor sample in the WOT area in 2014 were tested for CVOCs and every constituents was ND or well below residential ESLs.   SVOCs were the only WOT constituents not tested at the Site. A large excavation covering the majority of the Site down to at least 12 feet bgs was completed. SVOCs have low mobility potential in soils. Any SVOCs that would have been released in the environment was likely removed by the excavation activities.    SOILS:  Site Specific Target Levels (SSTLs) were developed for the Site prior to a 2009 excavation. The soil analytical results for samples obtained from soil remaining after the excavation were compared to the residential ESL and the SSTL. Based on soil borings advanced in 2007, petroleum constituents impacts in soil are defined laterally north and downgradient of the Site (west and southwest direction). Chemicals of concern concentrations (COCs) in soil were vertically delineated during installation of well clusters in October 2008 and were limited to the upper 10 feet. Following excavation, onsite in-place soils largely contain residual concentrations below SSTLs or commercial ESLs. Offsite impacts above SSTLs or ESLs are limited to the area near B-11 and MW-4 based on borings advanced in 2007 and monitoring wells installed in 2004. Maximum concentrations were 2,500 mg\/kg TPH-G (at B-5), 1.3 mg\/kg benzene (at MW-4), 50 mg\/kg ethylbenzene (at B-5).   GROUNDWATER:  Liquid-phase hydrocarbons (LPH) were found in MW-4 during several sampling events at up to 0.2 foot. LPH was last detected in September 2007. COCs concentrations in groundwater are stable or decreasing. Downgradient grab groundwater samples were collected in 2007 from borings B-10 and B-12 and contained no COCs, delineating the downgradient extent of groundwater impacts. Exceedances of ESLs were limited to shallow wells (screened from 13 to 18 feet bgs). Historically, maximum concentrations were detected in areas of the Site that were subsequently excavated to 12 feet bgs.    SOIL VAPOR:  Two onsite (including one near the former WOT area) and four offsite (downgradient and adjacent to nearby residential housing) soil vapor probes were installed in August 2014. Soil samples from all locations were ND for TPH-g and VOCs (including BTEX, MtBE, and naphthalene). Soil vapor samples were ND from all locations for TPH-g, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, MtBE, and naphthalene except one sample for MTBE at 6.6 µg\/m3 (below the residential ESL of 11,000 µg\/m3). The soil vapor sample from the soil probe at the location of the former WOT contain non-detectable (ND) or concentrations well below residential ESLs for chlorinated VOC constituents. All locations contained oxygen content of at least 15% in soils.    SENSITIVE RECEPTOR SURVEY:  In December 2006, using Department of Water Resources well logs and information obtained through the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD), no water supply wells were identified within a 2,000-foot distance of the Site. A review of the U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps indicated no that surface-water bodies are located within 2,000 feet of the Site. Based on these data, there are no sensitive groundwater receptors at risk due to impacts from the Site. Strawberry Creek runs east-west to the south of the Site. The creek is flowing in a culvert or underground for much of its length near the Site. The closest exposed stretch of Strawberry Creek is 1,000 feet southeast of the Site.    General Criteria  1. The unauthorized release is located within the service area of a public water system. The Site is located within the service area of the EBMUD.   2. The unauthorized release consists only of petroleum. COCs identified at the Site are indicative of a gasoline release. There are no nonpetroleum impacts or releases documented for the Site.  3. The unauthorized (“primary”) release from the UST system has been stopped. The unauthorized releases were stopped with the removal of all infrastructures in 2008.  4. Free product (FP) has been removed to the maximum extent practicable. FP was last detected in MW-4 during September 2007. Subsequent sampling events after September 2007 did not detect the presence of FP in MW-4. No FP was ever detected in the remaining wells.  5. A conceptual site model (CSM) that assesses the nature, extent, and mobility of the release has been developed. A CSM report has been submitted and is dated December 30, 2014.  6. Secondary source has been removed to the extent practicable. Secondary source(s) at the Site have been removed to the extent practical with the extensive excavation conducted between May and July, 2009 to depths of 12 to 16 feet bgs. A total of 5,660 tons of soil were removed and disposed offsite.    7. Soil or groundwater has been tested for MtBE and results were reported in accordance with Health and Safety Code Section 25296.15. Soil and groundwater samples collected at the Site have been analyzed for MtBE.   8. Nuisance as defined by Water Code Section 13050 does not exist at the site. No nuisance as defined by Water Code Section 13050 exists at this Site.    Media-Specific Criteria     • Groundwater: The Site meets the groundwater-specific criteria of Category 2 of the Low-Threat UST Closure Policy because: The contaminant plume exceeding water quality objectives (WQOs) is less than 250 feet long. The TPH-g plume exceeding 500 µg\/L is about 200 feet long. The benzene plume exceeding 27 µg\/L is about 190 feet long; and MtBE does not exceed the WQO. The groundwater plume is stable or decreasing.   No petroleum free product is present at the Site and offsite. The nearest existing water supply well or surface-water body is more than 1,000 feet from the defined plume boundary. The dissolved concentration of benzene is less than 3,000 ìg\/L and the dissolved concentration of MtBE is less than 1,000 ìg\/L. In 2014, the maximum benzene concentration was 220 µg\/L in MW-6 and the maximum MtBE concentration was 28 µg\/L in MW-3.  • Vapor intrusion to indoor air: Conditions at the Site satisfy the criteria of Scenario 4 as outlined in the Policy. Soil vapor samples were collected in August 2014. Benzene, ethylbenzene, and naphthalene concentrations in soil vapor were non-detect with oxygen content greater than four percent, thereby meeting Policy requirements.   • Direct contact and outdoor air exposure: Benzene, ethylbenzene, and naphthalene soil concentrations meet the direct contact and outdoor air exposure criteria presented in Table 1 of the Policy for commercial\/industrial land use.",

The site was historically occupied by a gasoline service station, and is currently occupied by a Biodiesel fueling station with above-ground storage tanks (ASTs).    Four underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed from the site in October 199 3. Three of the tanks contained gasoline and the fourth, smaller tank, contained waste oil. Soil samples collected from beneath the tanks and dispensers contained maximum concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline at 450 mg\/kg and benzene at 570 mg\/kg.    In October 1994, AEI installed three groundwater monitoring wells at the site. The wells were sampled on a quarterly basis between November 1994 and December 1996. No sampling was conducted during 1997, and the wells have been sampled on a semi-annual basis since 1998.    At the request of the client and the TMD, AEI prepared a work plan to further assess the extent of fuel hydrocarbon impacted groundwater, and determine whether the tetrachloroethene (PCE) and  other chlorinated organics originated on the subject site or from an offsite source. Reverse street directories and Sanborn Fire Insurance maps were reviewed, and it was determined that three  sites could be possible off-site sources for chlorinated organics.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is located at 1484 -1498 University Avenue, Berkeley, California in a mixed commercial residential area. The site's property is located on the southwestern corner of University Avenue and Sacramento Street in Berkeley. Currently, the 10,000 square feet (sf) property contains a commercial building. The first floor which is currently vacant. Seven residential units are located on the second floor, five of which are currently occupied. The east side of the parcel is divided into an enclosed play yard and an approximately 1,400 sf paved parking lot.     A Corrective Action Plan (CAP) dated August 2019, was submitted by Rue-Ell Enterprises, Inc., to comply with a July 9, 2019, directive by the Regional Water Quality Control Board (Water Board). The CAP is designed to remove petroleum impacted soil related to historical use of the property as a former automotive service station. The Water Board reviewed the CAP and provided written comments on September 9, 2019. We invited public comments on the proposed Corrective Action Plan (CAP) through November 30, 2019. A Revised CAP was approved by Water Board staff in July 2020. A CAP Completion Report is due November 31, 2020. A soil gas monitoring well was decommissioned and a piezometer was installed in September 2020 to assess groundwater in the excavation.    The goal of this CAP is to move the Site toward regulatory case closure under the Water Board’s Low Threat Case Closure Policy. Rue-Ell Enterprises, Inc. is committed to the remediation needed to achieve regulatory closure. There is no planned redevelopment for the property. Seismic upgrades have been performed. Occupancy for a day care center at 1484 University Avenue is pending.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Business Center is situated in the large, historic industrial building bounded by San Pablo Ave to the east, 9th to the west, Heinz Ave on the north, and Ashby Ave to the south.  Originally built by H.W. Heinz in 1927-28 as a cannery for his now-famous ketchup and relish products. The facility had two (2) underground storage tanks (USTs) for refueling their trucks (15,000-gal each, diesel fuel). The USTs were located on the western \/ northern side of the parcel (see basic site map in SAMPLING RESULTS FROM TANK REMOVAL documents dated 12\/11\/1987, page 4 of 22). Location of former USTs has been paved over with asphalt for driveway and parking. The previous owner had converted the function of the building to a retail office center and has been used as such by the current owner since the change in ownership in 1984 when the Heinz company moved operations to Tracy, California. Tanks were removed in 1987, with soil excavation and  off-site removal. In Sept 1993 TCE (Trichloroethene) was reported above (2,200 ug\/L in MW-3) regulatory limits for drinking water (5 ug\/L) and is suspect of an off-site source. With monitoring wells and analytical testing, request for case closure came in Jan 1995 based on non-detect levels of petroleum hydrocarbon compounds. Case Closure by the City of Berkeley, Toxics Management Division (TMD) in June of 2013 transferred the case to the Regional Water Board (SF Bay Region 2).  There is a likely orphaned TCE groundwater plume at the Site whose source has not been defined as of 9\/1\/16. The nature and extent of this orphaned groundwater has not been defined to date. This TCE detection in the sole onsite monitoring well exceeds the drinking water MCL. The Berkeley Business Center waste oil tank is not known to be the source of this TCE contamination at the Site.",

The site is approximately 50 feet above mean sea level (MSL) with relatively flat topography sloping gently to the west. The surrounding land use is primarily commercial. To determine current conditions at the site and evaluate site conditions against the LTCP criteria, CRA advanced soil borings B-12 through B-16 to assess shallow soil and attempted to collect grab-groundwater samples. CRA also rehabilitated monitoring well C-5, which had been damaged and paved over during construction activities at the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The former Veriflo facility operated as a metals-finishing plant from 1968 to 1994. The metals finishing process included five sumps which stored acidic solutions. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were also used at the Site and were stored in aboveground storage tanks (ASTs). After Veriflo discontinued operations in 1994, soil and groundwater investigations revealed chemical impacts to soil and groundwater beneath the Site.Results of the investigations indicated elevated concentrations of zinc, nickel, and chrome in shallow soils beneath the former chrome plating room. Elevated levels of VOCs, mostly TCE, were also detected in soil and groundwater sampled near the drain pipes, Sump F located in the pre-treatment room, and the sanitary sewer. In October and November 1996, soils were excavated to remove the heavy metals- and VOC-impacted soils outside the building. The plant building was demolished in 1999 as part of the purchase and sale agreement. Additional site investigation followed - 13 groundwater MWs were installed at and offsite. Onsite MWs decommissioned due to construction of a new building. There are four remaining offsite wells. Groundwater remediation 2000-2004: injections of potassium permanganate and later implementation of  EISB to stimulate degradation of VOCs. Site redeveloped w\/new building in 2005. The new building foundation is equipped with a vapor barrier. A passive vent system beneath the slab-on-grade foundation of the new building was installed as an additional mitigation measure to protect on-site occupants from potential intrusion by VOCs vapor. In July 2015 groundwater sampling event of the existing four offiste wells: MW-7, MW-8, MW-10, and MW-11. In general, concentrations of TCE and VC have decreased significantly.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Proen Products Company facility operated from approximately 1952 to June 1990. Proen manufactured fertilizer tablets, lawn sprinklers, and lawn edgers at the Site. the fertilizer tablet manufacturing operation was separate from the metal parts manufacturing operation. The fertilizer process consisted of combining fertilizer ingredients (e.g., urea) in a mixer and baking the combined ingredients in an oven.Metal sprinkler parts were manufactured from zinc alloy in the die casting operation and the metal parts cut in the punch press were cut from brass, aluminum, or steel sheets of metal. Solvents used for degreasing metal parts included 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA, reportedly used from 1982 to 1990) and trichloroethene (TCE, reportedly used before 1982). Carbon tetrachloride was reportedly used for degreasing during the earlier years of the facility's operation. Additional chemicals used at the facility reportedly included isopropanol, petroleum naphtha, dipping enamels, copper sulfate, Hampene 200 (EDTA), manganese sulfate, zinc sulfate, and Houghto-Safe 620 (ethylene glycol). Wastes removed and disposed off site by licensed contractors included paint thinner, waste paints, and waste 1,1,1-TCA.  Soil and groundwater investigations conducted in 1990 and 1991 revealed that elevated concentrations of VOCs were present in collected soil samples. The highest concentrations of VOCs and TPH-g and BTEX were detected in the hand augered boring SB -1 near the sump:TCE up to 2.2 mg\/kg in soil and up to 230 mg\/l in GW sample. Five MWs installed along the site perimeter (corner of 9th and Grayson St) in August 1990 to monitor the VOCs plume; additional eight wells installed in 1992. The highest concentrations of TCE was detected in MW-2 located downgradientfrom the Site. 1.4 mg\/l of TCE (April 1991).  Add site investigation and removal of the sump, soil excavation and removal of approx.. 1,130 tons  in May 1992; TCE was detected in soil up to 17 mg\/kg and in water up to 230 mg\/l. After the cleanup TCE concentrations were reduced to 0.68 mg\/kg and 0.068 mg\/l. Annual monitoring until 2009.    Groundwater monitoring continued thru 2020. Additional soil vapor sampling was completed in 2020 to address the potential for Vapor Intrusion of VOCs identified in groundwater. Sampling results showed that the site no longer poses an unacceptable risk to occupants; and no further remedial action is needed. The residual groundwater VOC plume will be addressed via natural attenuation. The Site is located within the City of Berkeley (COB) Environmental Management Area (EMA), and the potential for future exposures to offsite  impacted groundwater will be managed by the COB. The case was closed on 3\/3\/21 and an NFA letter was issued. Groundwater monitoring wells were decommissioned and results were reported 6\/1\/2021.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has been providing regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003411 since February 2020 subsequent to referral by the City of Berkeley Planning and Building Department.  To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as automobile service and repair operations with associated former underground storage tanks, dry cleaning facilities and a fire station.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil and soil vapor).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include remedial soil excavation and off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes a 6-story Lat-grade residential building with two elevators, a sump pump, and an outdoor courtyard compressed of landscaping and hardscaping.        The 0.82-acre Site is currently operating as a City of Berkeley owned public parking lot located at 2012 Berkeley Way in Berkeley, Alameda County, California. The Site is located in the North Berkeley neighborhood, in a mixed commercial and residential area, and east of the intersection between Berkeley Way and Milvia Street. Properties in the Site vicinity include single-family homes, multi-family apartments, commercial buildings, and the University of California, Berkeley campus. Historically the Site was used for residential dwellings prior to 1958.      Historical uses of adjacent or adjoining properties included dry cleaners, automotive repair, tire shop, and fire station with underground storage tanks (USTs).     Redevelopment of the Site is scheduled to commence in April 2020 and includes a six-floor, slab-on-grade, multi-residence building with two elevators, a sump pump, and an outdoor courtyard comprised of landscaping and hardscaping.    Multiple site investigations have been conducted in October 2018, and June, August, and October 2019 which included the assessment of soil and soil gas in the subsurface beneath the Site.  Results of these subsurface investigations have identified residual impact from lead in soil at several select locations at the Site exceeding applicable San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (SFBRWQCB) Tier 1 Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs). The presence of lead in soil is likely associated with the demolition of the former on-Site structures (that based on their age may likely have a history of lead-based paints), and\/or from aerially-deposited lead (ADL) associated with the former use of leaded gasoline in vehicles and nearby roadways.    A Fact Sheet and invitation for public comment regarding environmental assessments conducted at the Site was distributed by ACDEH to the surrounding community on February 11, 2020.  A public meeting was also conducted at the Berkeley public library on February 20, 2020.  No participants from the general public attended the meeting.    Additionally subsurface data gap assessment (DGA) investigations were conducted in late February 2020 to evaluate potential soil impacts from previously unassessed constituents, including polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and asbestos which may have been associated with the historical structures identified onsite. Additional soil vapor samples were also advanced  to further assess the potential for elevated soil vapor beneath the site.  Shallow soil results indicated lead was detected in all analyzed samples at concentrations ranging from 2.5 micrograms per kilogram (mg\/kg) to 94 mg\/kg; however, the Residential ESL was only exceeded in one sample (RB�]14 at 1 foot below ground surface [bgs]).  PCBs and asbestos was not detected in soil.      Based on the results of the DGA investigation a corrective action plan (CAP) was submitted to ACDEH for review on March 26, 2020.  Remedial and corrective actions presented in the CAP include remedial excavation of lead impacted soil via targeted remedial excavations prior to planned grading activities.",

Free product not detected June 2010 with decreasing concentrations of diesel.  Project is located in fill soil\/material of unknown source.  Migration to potential beneficial uses of groundwater is prohibited by thickly bedded clay soil.  No offsite impact or apparent health or environmental receptors.    Fiberglass underground storage tank removed 2\/1\/2018 exposed diesel impacted soil and groundwater at concentrations 100 times higher than environmental screening levels. City of Berkeley called in Water Board staff and concurred that a significant risk to human health and the environment existed and secondary source removal was practicable, that case should be reopened, and Water Board should be lead agency. In April 2019, the diesel impacted soil was over-excavated and three groundwater monitoring wells were installed in June 2019 for post-remediation verification monitoring.    In a January 10, 2020 letter, Regional Water Board staff approved a Data Gap Report and four quarterly groundwater monitoring reports and required Kaiser to submit a Low Threat Case Closure Evaluation Report by March 10. 2020. The Low Threat Case Closure Evaluation Report was submitted on March 10, 2020, which concluded the case met the State's Low Threat Case Closure Criteria. On March 23, 2020, the Water Board approved the March 10, 2020 report and issued a 60-day public comment notice to interested parties located within 250 feet radius of the site that a no further action determination is appropriate.  Case closed by Regional Water Quality Control Board on 9\/28\/2020.",

Except for the original residential use of the southeastern portion of the site (which ceased sometime prior to 1968), typical use of the site since the early 1900s has included a number of small commercial and\/or retail tenants, including a bakery, creamery, various medical and commercial offices, auto repair (circa 1920-1930), sign making, drug store, a theater, hardware store, and restaurants. As noted above, former dry cleaning operations were identified on site. An apartment complex is being built on the site.",

Analytical results of soil vapor samples from one probe destroyed during excavation historically contained benzene at concentrations up to 12,000 micrograms per cubic meter (ug\/m3). The destroyed probe was not replaced as part of site restoration activities and no post-excavation soil vapor samples were collected.    Henkel maintains ownership and operation of AOC 2. RedCo has purchased AOC 1 and intends to redevelop the property. In order to better track risk management\/remediation activities on AOC 1 during and post development, a new and separate GeoTracker site has been created (Global ID T10000017464).",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In 1984, primary and secondary sources for contamination have been removed to the extent feasible, when the voluntary remedial efforts were undertaken under the   supervision of the City of Berkeley Department of Health Services to remove pesticide and PCP contaminated source area soils within the unpaved area of the former   warehouse building. To date, no additional sources have been identified at the Site, and the Site has been redeveloped with a large warehouse building and thickened concrete   foundation system covering the entire limits of the property.    In January 2008, based on their review of the Supplemental Data report, the DTSC agreed with Fugro’s recommendation that the exposed soil along the embankment be capped as an interim remedial measure, until such time that the Site could be remediated along with Site redevelopment plans. No time limit was placed on the completion of the work. The DTSC also indicated they would develop a Land Use Covenant (LUC) for the Site given the presence of the engineered cap, which would likely cite the need for a site-specific Soil and Groundwater Management Plan when future redevelopment occurs. In July 2008, the DTSC prepared a draft Voluntary Cleanup Agreement (VCA), which if executed, would require a LUC for future usage of the site to be prepared. The VCA was not formalized because the Site owner had begun new plans to redevelop the Site. Fugro completed annual Site inspections starting in 2008 to confirm the Site uses and surficial conditions have remained unchanged. The most recent inspection conducted in 2018 indicated the Site conditions remained unchanged (Fugro, 2018).    On 29 September 2020, Fugro conducted a well inventory at the Site and the adjacent properties to identify and document the conditions and accessibility of existing monitoring wells and temporary wells\/piezometers (Fugro, 2020). Fugro confirmed the presence of seven accessible wells in the interior of the 2220 Fourth Street property (M-1, M-2, M-4, and S-7 through S-10) and two accessible wells adjacent to the property within the sidewalk along Fourth Street (M-5 and M-6). At each location, Fugro was able to open the well lid, sound the depth to groundwater, and sound the depth to bottom using a weighted tape and\/or a Solinst water level meter. No separate phase petroleum liquid or free product was observed; however, odors were observed in wells S-7 through S-10.",

The Site has reportedly been utilized as either a used car lot or a parking lot since at least 1950 and earlier Sanborn maps and aerial photos show the site occupied by a dwelling. The Site formerly housed a gasoline dispenser and waste oil UST to service two 1,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs) that operated at the adjacent Holland Service garage from 1963 through 1987. The gasoline and waste oil USTs were removed in 1987.     Groundwater and soil data from investigations conducted in January and March of 2020 indicate that petroleum hydrocarbons are present beneath the Site.

The area has been in heavy industrial use for over 100 years and other recognized sources of contamination are nearby. When operations ceased in 2004, the property contained buildings, aboveground and underground storage tanks (ASTs and USTs), and related infrastructure. Surface spills of diesel, motor oil and kerosene were present near the ASTs, and at least 3 of the 7 identified USTs may have leaked or been overfilled. Primary source removal in 2005 and 2006 included demolition of all ASTs, associated pipes, and any affected infrastructure; closure in place by City of Berkeley Toxics Management Department of two potentially leaking USTs which are under slabs and structural elements of historic buildings; removal of one leaking 300-gallon UST; removal of four intact USTs; and discovery and closure of two deep process water wells. Secondary source removal included excavation and removal of 19,000 tons of impacted soil and replacement with clean fill; and removal and disposal of approximately 370,000 gallons of groundwater. A ground water monitoring program with 13 wells was established that tests for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and volatile organic compound (VOCs). VOCs are currently present in groundwater in the northeast corner of the site. A No Further Action\/Closure Letter for the ASTs and UST releases was issued for the property located at 1350 Fourth Street, a portion of the former Flint Ink facility.",

A large industrial warehouse resides on the Site, with access from Fourth Street. Neighboring warehouses abut the Site and buildings such as a wine distributor and a specialized commercial coating company to the north. Various industrial metals businesses have used the Site including metal fabricators, machine shops, foundries, laboratories and paint manufacturing. Other previous business have included pesticide companies who used thinners (solvents) with their pesticide mixes. These solvents included Pentachlorophenol (PCP) mixed with kerosene (a petroleum distillate) and diesel fuel. Use of heavy metals, hydrocarbon fuels, oils, lubricant, degreasers, cutting fluids, solvents, acids, bases, and dyes \/ paint intermediates were found at previous on-Site business operations. Known and documented releases of these and other hydrocarbon compounds have been documented from the Site.     Local soil and groundwater on Site has been impacted from vertical and lateral migration of these hydrocarbon and related contaminants. detected concentrations of hydrocarbons include total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd) up to 39,000 ug\/L in groundwater (Environmental Screening Levels for TPHd in groundwater are 200 ug\/L). PCP was identified up to 460 mg\/kg in on-Site soil samples. TPH as kerosene (jet fuel) was found up to 6,000 mg\/kg in soil and TPH up to 10,000 mg\/kg in soil.    In October 2021, Haley &amp; Aldrich, Inc., (Haley &amp; Aldrich) prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) on behalf of W-SW WBLS West Owner IX, L.P. c\/o SteelWave, LLC (SteelWave) as requested by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (SFRWQCB) for the SFRWQCB-regulated property located at 2220 Fourth Street (Site; Figure 1). The Site is part of a larger redevelopment project, SteelWave’s theLAB West Block, which will include demolition of the structure on the 2220 Fourth Street property as well as demolition of four existing structures adjacent to the Site: 701, 705, 705A and 747 Bancroft Way.

The pits are approximately 15 feet apart from each other. Each L-shaped pit contains a long and short side that are up to 12 feet long by 18 inches wide and four feet long by 16 inches wide, respectively. The depth of each pit and casing extend to 9 feet below the ground surface (bgs). Because the equipment is no longer used, the City plans for safely abandoning the hydraulic lifts.  The latest investigation results of hydraulic lifts, indicates the case is eligible for closure.(see report dated January 4, 2022). The City of Berkeley intends to conduct in-place closure of four hydraulic lifts at the Equipment Maintenance Shop.",

In December 1985, three (3) 500-gal steel, non-coated, underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed off-Site by Blaine Tech Services. Two of the USTs had a gas \/ water mixture when pulled, along with rust and holes. Environmental soil sampling in 1995 detected total volatile hydrocarbons (TVH) as gasoline (TPHg) at a maximum concentration of 69 mg\/kg; ethyl benzene at 1200 ug\/kg; and total xylenes at 4,000 ug\/kg. Methyl tert butyl ethylene (MTBE) was determined as a required contaminant to sample for prior to any considerations for case closure. This Site was formerly known as the Keith Property. The Site named was changed in November 2015 in GeoTracker. Additional assessment demonstrated no issues and site was granted closure on September 16, 2016.",

The portion of the site referred to as the Berkeley Industrial Complex was historically utilized as a storage area for old equipment, spent dolomite, and neutralized chemical etching waste before disposal. Prior to Airco's ownership of the site, Hall Scott Marine Engine Foundry occupied the site before and during World War II. They produced engines for naval ships during World War II; however, the exact scope of their activities is unknown.     The site currently supports three buildings and a nursery on an approximately 1.5-acre parcel. Berkeley Industrial Complex is presently a multi-tenant industrial complex. The main tenants include Magic Garden Nursery, Goldberg Cabinets, and Artworks Foundry. Seventy-five percent of the property is utilized to grow, store and sell plants, shrubs, and trees. The site is bounded by Temescal Business Center to the east, and National Starch and Chemical to the north. A Southern Pacific rail spur forms the northwest boundary. Since 1978 there has been no chemical storage or heavy industrial practices that would lend to the potential for soil and\/or groundwater impaction. The site is currently being investigated for off-site soil vapor concentrations.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has been providing regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003442 since August 2020 subsequent to referral by the City of Berkeley Planning and Building Department.  To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as automobile service and repair operations with associated former underground storage tanks, and a bank.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil, soil vapor, and groundwater).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include the hazardous material survey and abatement of the existing onsite building and hardscape; demolition of existing Site buildings and above ground infrastructure; remediation and\/or off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; extraction, treatment, and discharge of groundwater to the sanitary sewer; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes a six-story multi-family residential building with 87 affordable family housing apartments and commercial tenant space, community facilities, utility and mechanical rooms, and garage parking on the ground floor. Construction will consist of a slab on grade foundation, with elevators and subterranean car stacker pits..            The Site is located in a mixed commercial and residential area of South Berkeley at the northeast corner of Adeline Street and Ashby Avenue.  The property consists of one parcel, assessor parcel number (APN) 53-1591-18-3, totaling approximately 0.64 acres. According to the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (Phase I ESA), dated December 4, 2019, the current parcel consisted of at least 6 historical parcels with associated addresses including 2031 &amp; 2033 Ashby Avenue and 2925-2933 Adeline Street.  APN for these address could not be located in County Assessor records.    The Site is bound to the northwest by Adeline Street and further north by various mixed commercial and residential buildings; to the east by additional commercial properties; to the south by a church and residential land-use; and to the west by commercial properties.  The Site is currently occupied by one building (6,297 square feet) used as a credit union\/bank surrounded by an asphalt paved parking lot.     Demolition of existing structures and redevelopment is proposed at this Site, however, at this time limited information is available for the proposed redevelopment that will include both commercial and residential land use.     Various configurations and historical operations were conducted at the Site.  These site configurations and operations included dwellings as early as 1903 in the northern portion of the Site as observed in the Sanborn maps provided in the Phase I ESA. By 1911, the Site also contained a store building in the southeast corner and a structure labeled as “waiting room” in the southwest corner. A building permit reviewed dated December 19, 1936 was a certificate of occupancy for a service station at the Site. The 1939 aerial photograph shows this gasoline service station. The city directory listings show that a gasoline service station was present at the Site (2001 Ashby Avenue) in 1945 through at least 1962. The city directory also showed that a store building with various commercial\/retail businesses occupied the historical building (2031 &amp; 2033 Ashby Avenue) from at least 1920 to 1970. A further look at building permits show an original building permit dated July 30, 1946 was issued for a gasoline service station. The City of Berkeley approved of a building permit for the construction of a bank on February 11, 1969 and signed off on the demolition of the former Site buildings on February 13, 1969. Fire Department records confirm that on February 12, 1969, the Site buildings and two underground storage tanks (USTs) (size and contents not provided) were removed. The present-day Site bank building and parking lot is assumed to have been constructed in 1969.    The City of Berkeley Toxics Management Division records identified a letter dated November 2, 1998 review a Phase 1 ESA, dated July 17, 1998 in addition to a soil &amp; groundwater report, dated October 13, 1998.  Phase I ESA results indicated recognized environmental conditions (REC) related to the former gasoline service station at the Site and also identified  REC-related activities upgradient from active Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) cases. The findings and conclusions of the soil &amp; groundwater report prepared by ATC Associates, Inc., indicated that petroleum hydrocarbons and halogenated volatile organic compounds in the groundwater were detected at levels below the maximum contaminant levels (MCL) or levels relatively low and not considered to pose significant threat to human health or to the environment.  Based on these findings, no further action was required regarding soil and groundwater at the Site, however, the City of Berkeley recommended a limited site investigation for the Site prior to a change in use of the Site. Copies of the 1998 Phse I ESA or Subusrface Investigation Report have not been provided to ACDEH at this time.    Additional subsurface investigation activities were conducted at the Site in April 2019 and described in the Limited Subsurface Investigation Report, dated May 9, 2019, prepared by Ninyo &amp; Moore. These subsurface investigation activities included the advancement of five shallow borings (S-1 through S-5) to a depth of 2.0 feet below ground surface (bgs) or less. Two temporary soil vapor probes were advanced to a total depth of 5.5 feet bgs and included the collection of soil and soil vapor between 5.0 feet to 5.5 feet bgs.  Soil samples were selectively analyzed for gasoline-, diesel-, and motor oil-range total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH-g, TPH-d, TPH-mo) volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX), Leaking Underground Fuel Tank (LUFT) 5 metals, and California Title 22 metals. Petroleum related chemicals of concern (COCs) were detected in the soil samples sample at 2 feet bgs, however ACDEH notes these soil samples were collected at a depth above the former USTs. Soil samples also detected metal COCs including arsenic, lead and nickel above applicable regulatory screening levels for residential land use.  Soil vapor samples were only collected from one soil vapor probe (SV-1) and indicated VOCs were detected above laboratory detection levels. Petroleum and non-petroleum related COCs were detected in soil vapor including but not limited tert-Butyl alcohol (TBA), ethylbenzene, toluene, chloromethane, carbon disulfide, and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK).  Groundwater was not collected during the April 2019 investigations.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is an active service station dispensing 76�-branded gasoline located on the northeast corner of the intersection of Ashby Avenue and 7th Street in Berkeley, Alameda County, California. The Alameda County Assessor�'s Parcel Number is 53�-1641�-9�5. The site is located on 0.18�-acre lot approximately 3,000 feet west of the San Francisco Bay. The service station is located at an elevation of approximately 30 feet above mean sea level.    The site is located in a mixed commercial and industrial area and is bounded on the south by Ashby Avenue (State Highway 13), to the north by Potter Street, to the east by a commercial facility (tub makers), and to the west by 7th Street (beyond which is the former Whole Earth Access\/West Marine facility).     The station facilities include four 12,000�-gallon underground storage tanks (USTs) containing regular unleaded, mid�]grade unleaded, premium unleaded, and diesel fuels; three fuel dispenser islands; and a small cashier�fs kiosk located in the central portion of the site. Other site features include a treatment system compound containing an air�-sparging\/dual-phase extraction system.    A service station reportedly has occupied the site for at least 50 years. Southland Corporation (Southland) reportedly acquired the property in 1982, and installed the existing four 12,000�-gallon, single�]walled, fiberglass USTs at the site in 1983 for storage of regular, unleaded, premium unleaded, and diesel fuel and operated a Super 7 Service Station at the site. It is not known if USTs were present on�]site during previous service station operations. In 1986, ownership of the property was transferred to Mr. Keet Neerhan, who subsequently sold the property to Mr. Marvin Goodwyn in 1987. Mr. Goodwyn then leased the property to Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) in 1987. Unocal operated a service station at the site until 1997. Tosco Marketing Company (now ConocoPhillips) assumed the existing site lease in 1997, and currently operates the 76 service station. In 2003, the property was sold to Mr. Ronald Siegel.    Mark Bare will provide summarizing our current knowledge of the nature, extent, potential source of this orphaned groundwater and likely soil vapor plume.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is an approximately 0.16-acre property located within a commercial business district at 1507-1511 San Pablo Avenue. A residential neighborhood adjoins the Site to the east. The Site includes three commercial\/light industrial buildings constructed between about 1945 and 1955: (1) The main former Pullman Cleaner building at 1507 San Pablo Avenue on the northwest side of the Site; (2) A smaller building, 1507½ San Pablo Avenu), on the northeast side of the Site associated with the former dry cleaner; and (3) a former storage building  at 1509\/1511 San Pablo Avenue on the south side of the Site. The Site is currently vacant except for an art studio in a second-floor suite within the 1509-1511 building.The Site was developed and operated as Pullman Cleaners around 1947. The dry cleaning facility apparently used Stoddard solvent initially, and began using tetrachloroethene (PCE) in 1954. Dry cleaning at the Site was discontinued sometime prior to 1979, and a woodworking facility occupied the Site from approximately 1979 to 2004. In 1993, three 1,300-gallon vertically-aligned underground storage tanks (USTs) were identified between 1507 and 1507½ San Pablo Avenue buildings. In 1996, the three USTs were closed in-place. During UST closure activities, approximately 25 tons of overburden soil and 900 gallons of groundwater were disposed offsite. Prior to backfilling, extraction standpipes were placed in each of the three exposed tanks, and another 1,500 gallons of groundwater was removed for disposal. Moderate concentrations of gasoline, diesel, and Stoddard solvent were found in soil samples collected during these activities, but no halogenated volatile organic compounds (HVOCs) were found. Between 1997 and 2000, 18 soil borings were drilled and sampled and groundwater monitoring wells MW-1 through MW-5 were installed and sampled at the Site. Groundwater samples from the borings and wells showed a localized Stoddard solvent hydrocarbon plume extending west from the location of the former Site USTs; and a more extensive HVOC plume extending at least 80 feet west-northwest from the southern dry cleaning machine. Indoor air samples contained elevated concentrations of HVOCs, and PCE levels exceeded the environmental screening levels for commercial land use. In July 2016 two new wells (MW-6 and MW-7) were installed on the west side of San Pablo Ave. A deed restriction and a site management plan will be submitted to aid in evaluating the site for case closure.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is a 1.123 acre lot with a warehouse that is located along the frontage road (Eastshore Hwy) of Interstate 80 just north of the Gilman Street exit in northwest Berkeley. The warehouse had been occupied by the Hawkins Traffic Safety Supply Company since 1943. Site operations included screen printing and powder coating traffic signs; and unspecified \"treatment of aluminum\". Reported wastes generated from site operations are as follows: inorganic solid waste, liquid corrosive waste, sludge containing chromium VI and electroplating waste. The Site is underlain by fill material consisting of various debris (wood, concrete and soil). Adjacent land uses are predominantly commercial - industrial with Public Storage to the north and industrial welding supply to the south, a waste transfer station across 2nd Street, and a foundry to the south across Gilman Street. The Site is 1,200 feet east of San Francisco Bay and there are no water supply wells located within 1 mile of the site. Weatherford BMW leases the property for automobile sales or repairs.    Hydrocarbon and volatile organic compound (VOC) impacted soils were identified at the Site during trenching activities associated with site improvements. Phase II investigations indicated that soils and shallow groundwater contained concentrations of hydrocarbons and VOCs exceeding the Tier 1 Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs). Required additional investigations were completed to define the nature and extent of soil, soil vapor and groundwater contamination; and evaluate potential indoor air impacts via the vapor intrusion exposure pathway. Based on the data reported it appears that COCs identified in the subsurface are not migrating to indoor air via vapor intrusion pathway. The lateral extent of VOC impacted groundwater has not been adequately defined, therefore Regional Water Board staff required two additional groundwater monitoring wells be installed to collect necessary data. The detection of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) were detected in 2019, but are belived to be from an off-site source. Groundwater concentrations of VOCs and CVOCs have demonstarted a stable and or decrease trend. The site is elegible for closure following a closure fact sheet with a 30-day public comment period.",

The property was purchased by Terminal in 1988 from a former trucking company that operated four underground storage tanks (USTs) along the western side of the property. The installation date of the USTs is unknown, however it was reported by the previous property owner that the USTs were emptied of their contents and decommissioned in the late 1970s, approximately 10 years before being purchased by Terminal.    In 1999, the four USTs were removed from the Site. It included the removal of two 2,000-gallon waste oil tanks (USTs 3 and 4); one 4,000-gallon diesel (kerosene range) fuel tank (UST 2) and one 2,000- gallon gasoline fuel tank (UST 1) along with the closure and sampling of waste water sumps and associated piping.",

Groundwater and soil contaminated with total and hexavalent chromium. Soil and groundwater chromium contamination has been found on- and offsite. In 1991 the City of Berkeley TMD required  the RP to prepare a work plan for chromium 6 contamination delineation in soil and GW, a feasibility study for corrective actions to remove chromium from soil and GW, risk assessment, and evaluation of the facility storm water pollution prevention plan. Implementation of the in-situ reduction of Cr 6 to Cr 3 as proposed in the 3\/1998 Arcadis Gerathy &amp; Miller revised CAP; installation of 12 injection points on- and offsite and injections of an enriched carbohydrate solution into the saturated and vadose zones in 12\/1998 and 4\/1999. Site closure requested from the TMD in April 2005 by Tamalpais Environmental Consultants (TEC) based on low concentrations in GW. Additional subsurface treatments in 11\/2008 to address residual Cr 6 at the site based on results from well MW-1 downgradient of the former source area. Temporary injection points installed to inject a remediation mixture w\/whey and an emulsified soybean oil. An additional round of groundwater remediation injections performed in four locations in June 2013 to address chromium 6 detected in well MW-1.The concentration of chromium 6 in MW-1 was below 10 ug\/L during the groundwater monitoring events conducted in 12\/2014 and 12\/2015 by TEC .",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Vegetable Oil Company, a subsidiary of the Stauffer Oil Company, began construction of the earliest known buildings to occupy the site in 1916-17. All that remains of these earliest structures are the Copra Building (currently owned by Garr Land &amp; Resources, Inc.) And the smokestack of the recently demolished Boiler Room Building.   Durkee Famous Foods (hereinafter referred to as Durkee), a subsidi­ary of Glidden Foods, purchased the site and buildings in 1929. Durkee expanded many of existing buildings and constructed the distinctive Art Deco \"Durkee Building\", 800 Heinz Avenue, on the northern boundary of the site. Additional expansion of the plant occurred following World War II when building permits were issued for the hydrogenation building, cooling tower deodorizer, storage\/ office area, lighted electric sign, and the experimental kitchen. These developments allowed Durkee to describe the plant as the largest refinery of edible oil on the Pacific Coast.   Durkee ceased refinery operations at the plant in 1974. The plant lay dormant until November 1976 when Agricom, Inc., an oil processing firm from San Francisco, purchased the property and buildings. Agricom continued to refine vegetable oil at the plant until declaring bankruptcy in 1984. During Agricom•s occupation, small portions of the site were rented for other light industrial uses, small businesses, and live\/work uses. This included the leasing of the 700 Heinz Avenue property to EBWRI in 1983.   In 1985, Wareham Development (Seventh Street Properties II) purchased the site from Charles Duck, the bankruptcy trustee for Agricom, Inc. This purchase included hazardous waste and hazardous materials (caustic liquids) contained in open tanks and sumps on the site, as well as asbestos sidings and coverings on the old Warehouse Building. In June 1985, Wareham Development began the demolition of the buildings on the 2900 Fifth Street property, whereas the 700 Heinz Avenue property was still under lease to EBWRI, who continued to occupy the site until August 1986.   In July 1985, the Environmental Health Division of the City of Berkeley, Department of Health and Human Services discovered a black­colored, caustic (pH = 12.6), oily liquid seeping into the drainage swale located on the adjacent SP right-of-way. After a more detailed inspection of the site, the City of Berkeley contacted the California Department of Health Services (DOHS) to further assist in site investi­gations. The OOHS issued an Order to Post and Fence the area (29 July 1985) and the City of Berkeley issued an Abatement Order (30 July 1985) requiring that the demolition of the site structures be delayed until contamination characterization work be implemented and a remedial action plan developed.   The DOHS issued a Determination of Imminent or Substantial Endangerment and Remedial Action Order (August 1985) after inventorying waste products on the 2900 Fifth Street property and sampling the black liquid found in the drainage swale. The order required the removal of the black liquid, a detailed site characterization clean-up of the waste products identified on the 2900 Fifth Street property, and an investigation into the source of the black liquid.   The black liquid was removed from the SP drainage swale in Septem­ber 1985. However, within two weeks after removal of the liquid, the seepage reappeared in the drainage swale. In response to the DOHS orders, Wareham Development and EBWRI each retained consultants to perform site investigation studies, and clean-up of the 2900 Fifth Street property was initiated.",

The building consists of approximately 5,700 square feet of ground-floor retail space and ten second-floor residential lofts. A Phase I investigation in mid-2004 identified PCE contamination in soil and groundwater. Site characterization, corrective action implementation, and installation of 3 monitoring wells were conducted in 2004 to 2005. The corrective action included removal of contaminated soil from the Site. Quarterly monitoring was conducted until the monitoring frequency was reduced to semiannual in 2009.  Additional corrective action was proposed in 2011. Injection of amendments to stimulate  in situ bioremediation was conducted in November 2011 and February 2012. The post-corrective action GW monitoring is conducted on the semi-annual basis. Significant VOCs concentration rebound in GW samples from MWs after 2013. Another round of injections to promote microbial biodegradation in August 2016.     RP stopped groundwater monitoring in 2017. Agency oversight limited due to oversight cost recovery agreement no longer in affect. Current (2020) groundwater conditions need to be addressed; VI potential needs to be reconsidered (since 2012) because risks due to VOCs in soil vapor have been reevaluated and new soil vapor and groundwater ESLs have been established. Both of these items need to be addressed before site closure can be considered.",

The fuel UST was replaced by two USTs in 1988, a 6,000-gal diesel UST and one 4,000-gal gasoline UST. In July, 1994 a heating oil UST from offsite (620 Hearst Street) was removed, and in October 1994 a release of heating oil and diesel was reported by Azure Environmental. In June, 1994 three (3) groundwater monitoring wells were installed. In September 1998, the Toxics Management Division (TMD) of the City of Berkeley requested the former USTs be removed. Tank removal began in 1999, and excavations were bac-filed by February 2000, followed by a request for 'no further action'. Case transfer to Regional Board from TMD was issued in June 2013.",

Four underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed from the site in October 1993. Three of the tanks contained gasoline and the fourth, a smaller UST, contained waste oil. Soil samples collected from beneath the USTs and dispensers contained maximum concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline at 450 mg\/kg and benzene at 570 mg\/kg. Based on the results of this soil sampling, the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (ACHCSA) requested that the property owner conduct a groundwater investigation.    Following the January 2002 soil and groundwater investigation, AEI began quarterly groundwater monitoring and sampling activities on wells MW-1 through MW-3. On March 4, 2003, three soil borings were advanced and converted to groundwater monitoring wells (MW-4 through MW-6).",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is developed with a rectangular brick building that covers more than half of a city block bounded by Camelia Street on the south, Ninth Street on the west, and Tenth Street on the east.  A Canada Dry bottling plant occupied the site from its initial development until 1978. The southern half of the site building was occupied by Perc-Serv, Inc., a wholesale laundry and dry cleaning supply business, from 1978 to 1983. In 1985, the site building was renovated to its current use as a multi-tenant retail, office, and warehouse. Permits for the 1955 installation and 1978 removal of a 7,500 gal underground gasoline storage tank (UST) have been found. Gasoline constituents associated with the former UST include benzene, a recognized carcinogen.  Soil and groundwater samples from the loading dock area on the west side of the Site showed elevated levels of some halogenated volatile organic compounds (HVOCs), indicating, primarily, tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE) and cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (c-1,2-DCE). HVOC impacted groundwater is present out to approximately one block west-southwest from the Site to Eighth Street and does not appear to extend south to a predominantly a residential neighborhood.    A draft workplan was submitted February 2020 (finalized in March 2020) for soil, groundwater, soil vapor and indoor air investigations to evaluate VOC impacts and complete site characterization necessary to determine remedial actions for site cleanup. The workplan proposed sequential tasks with results summaries issued following tasks. The Water Board approved the workplan 4\/3\/2020. Site investigation and cleanup are ongoing. Completion of excavation and a vapor mitigation system are planned for the source area building by 2022.",

Soil samples taken from the over-excavation during the tank removal detected up to 13,000 mg\/kg total oil and grease (TOG), 4,200 mg\/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), and 1,200 mg\/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg). In March, 1995 one 10,000-gal, one previously-undocumented 750-gal and two (2) 8,000-gal gasoline USTs were removed from the Site. Soils samples then taken after UST removal detected 1,300 and 1,800 mg\/kg TPHg and 5.6 and 11 mg\/kg benzene. Quarterly groundwater monitoring has been conducted since Nov. 1989. MTBE (methyl tert butyl ethylene) was detected up to 16,700 ug\/L in groundwater.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This case is an active commercial petroleum fueling facility. An unauthorized release was reported in August 1994 as a result of inventory reconciliation. USTs (four gasoline, one diesel) were tested and retrofitted and piping was removed and replaced in 1995. Historically, one of the gasoline USTs and one of the diesel USTs were formerly utilized for waste oil storage. Approximately 350 cubic yards of impacted soil and overburden were removed and disposed offsite in 1995. No groundwater monitoring wells have been installed at the Site. According to grab groundwater data collected from soil borings, water quality objectives for benzene and MTBE have not been achieved and the contaminant plume is undefined.    The petroleum release is limited to the soil and shallow groundwater. According to data available in GeoTracker, there are no supply wells regulated by the California Department of Public Health within 1,000 feet of the Site. No other water supply wells have been identified within 1,000 feet of the Site in files reviewed. There is no identified surface water within 250 feet of the Site. The nearest surface water body, Strawberry Creek, is located approximately 700 feet north-northeast of the Site. Water is provided to water users near the Site by the East Bay Municipal Utilities District. The affected groundwater is not currently being used as a source of drinking water, and it is highly unlikely that the affected groundwater will be used as a source of drinking water in the foreseeable  future.",

Grab groundwater samples collected during a later investigation contained detectable concentrations of gasoline, oil and grease, 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA,), and 1,2-dichlorethene (1,2-DCE). A remedial excavation was conducted on the site to remove a clarifier in 1999. In 2001, product lines and dispensers were removed and replaced; soil samples collected following excavation indicated soil contamination, and 400 cubic yards of soil and approximately 15,000 gallons of groundwater were removed from beneath the site during excavation. Investigations downgradient of the site indicated that there were no to low levels of offsite groundwater contamination. Due to historic landfill practices that allowed the disposal of contaminated soil in this region of Emeryville, the identification of similar contamination at the adjacent site to the north of the subject site, and the high probability of not being able to distinguish between contaminant sources, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health has found that case closure is appropriate for this site.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The site is currently a marina commercial fueling facility.  The site sits on a spit created in the mid 1950’s by Bay fill including brick and other man made materials.  Four single–walled USTs were removed in April 1992.  The UST excavation was enlarged to allow the installation of a larger double-walled steel and fiberglass UST.  At the time sheen was observed in the UST basin at removal and elevated groundwater concentrations were recorded.  Well MW-1 was installed in April 1993 within 10 feet of the excavation.  The site is bounded by the SF Bay and the SF Bay Harbor (less than 125 feet from point of release).  Groundwater and soil contamination appears to be adequately delineated.  Depth to groundwater at the site is approximately 5 feet and may potentially intersect utility trenches in the vicinity of the site; however, recent groundwater concentrations at well MW-1 meet Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) that are protective of Estuary surface waters.    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP).  Under the current land use as an active fueling station, the site is not required to meet media-specific criteria for vapor intrusion to indoor air and therefore has not been evaluated for vapor intrusion; however, the closest building to the release location is approximately 120 feet to the south-southeast.  The site meets all other general and medial specific criteria and therefore, case closure is granted for the current commercial land use as an active fueling station.    If a change in land use to any residential, commercial other than as a commercial fueling station, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.    Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    This site is to be entered into the City of Emeryville Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.",

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The site is currently developed as a commercial property and is occupied by Peets corporate headquarters.  Site development includes office buildings on the southern portion of the parcel and a parking lot on the northern portion of the parcel.    The site was historically used by the Chromex Corporation as a chrome plating facility.   Chromex ceased operations in January 1991.  Facility closure activities started in April 1991.  Regulatory oversight of closure activities has been provided by Department of Toxic Substance Control, the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, and Alameda County Environmental Health (ACEH).      ACEH Site Cleanup Program (SCP) case number RO0002656 was opened to deal with non-petroleum underground storage tank (UST) contamination.  ACEH Fuel Leak Case number RO0000398 was opened for the cleanup of UST related petroleum contamination (three 550-gallon USTs - two gasoline, one diesel and \/ or motor oil removed in October 1995).    Chromex ceased operations in January 1991.  Facility closure activities started in April 1991, and included the removal of eight Above Ground Storage Tanks (ASTs) that had been located in either a below-grade concrete vault or an aboveground bermed area.  The former below grade concrete vault was removed in April 1992, and 40 tons of soil with elevated metals, including chromium, was also removed.  Four soil bores were installed in October 1992 to delineate the extent of chromium impacted soils about the vault and only several of the one foot samples contained metals values over potential regulatory concern.  Grab groundwater was successfully collected in three of the four bores, all metals results were acceptable; however, several VOCs were detected and were attributed to offsite sources.  In December 1994 six soil bores (SB-1 to SB-6) were installed, and three wells were installed (MW-1 to MW-3).  Chromium, hexavalent chrome, and lead were detected in soil or groundwater, but below regulatory concern.  HVOCs were also present and were ultimately attributed to offsite sources, with similar concentrations.    As part of the closure activities a vertical honing pit was excavated in July 1995 and 75 cubic yards (112.36 tons) of associated soil were removed.  Concentrations up to 870 ppm were left in place due to limitations imposed by the building and the sidewalk.  In December 1996 well MW-4 was installed in proximity to the honing pit excavation.  In 1997 a half buried AST was abandoned in-place; it may have been utilized for storm water.  Well MW-3 was decommissioned under permit in February 1999.  The three remaining wells were redeveloped and sampled in January 2007; all hydrocarbon concentrations were non-detectable.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In October 2019, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) received a Preliminary Screening Application from Omni Group for a proposed redevelopment project at the subject site. Subsequent to ACDEH's preliminary screening of the proposed project, ACDEH notified the Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) who had been the lead agency for a previous proposed redevelopment project that was put on hold (EnviroStor Case BRE GATEWAY DEVELOPMENT (60000651)), of its intent to enter into a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement (VRAA) with Omni Group to provide oversight of the environmental investigation and cleanup during site redevelopment.  On October 20, 2019, DTSC referred environmental oversight at the site to ACDEH. As of 03\/14\/2020 Omni Group has not entered into a VRAA with ACDEH    The current proposed redevelopment project is in the entitlement approval phase  with the City of Emeryville Planning Department (reference number UPDR18-003). The project  includes demolition of the one-story commercial building at 5855 Christie Avenue and parking lots on the project site; the retention f the six-story office building, and development of two new towers (one 54 story residential tower and one 15-story office tower) both sitting on top of a parking podium that will contain parking and ground floor commercial space. The project is currently under CEQA review with the City of Emeryville. The final EIR is anticipated to be published in the spring of 2020.      Site History From Department of Toxic Substance Control Board's Envirostor database: In the early 1900’s, the Site and surrounding area were part of the San Francisco Bay tidal plain. By the early 1910’s, the Site was being used as a landfill and located within the boundary of the Paraffin Paint Company, which occupied buildings north and east of the Site. By the late 1930’s, Paraffin Paint Company had become Paraffine Companies, Inc. (PABCO), a manufacturer or roofing and flooring materials. The Site was occupied by several commercial buildings associated with PABCO. The surrounding area was occupied by heavy industrial development. In the early 1950’s, PABCO had one large building and two small buildings on-site. The large building was a linoleum manufacturing facility. By the late 1960’s, PABCO was no longer on-site, and all buildings and structures on-site were gone. The former PABCO buildings north of the Site were occupied by Fiberboard Paper Products Corporation. By the early 1970’s, the two current buildings on-site had been developed. These buildings are in use for commercial and office purposes.     The 3.3-acre Site is relatively flat and covered by pavement, buildings and landscaped areas. A six-story building occupies the southwestern portion of the Site, and a single-story commercial building occupies the northern portion of the Site. Both buildings are occupied by tenants. The Site is bordered on the south by a gas station and restaurant, on the west by Interstate 80\/580, on the north by a parking lot and buildings, and on the east by Christie Avenue. Soils on-site generally consist of fill materials interbedded with gravelly sands and clay. The fill materials include pebbles and debris such as brick, concrete, asphalt, roofing felt, tar paper, wood and metal. Regional topography generally slopes west toward San Francisco Bay, which is less than 0.2 mile from the Site. Depth to groundwater is approximately 6.5 feet below ground surface. Groundwater flow is westward toward San Francisco Bay.    DTSC and BRE Gateway Properties executed a Voluntary Cleanup Agreement on 10-12-07. DTSC staff review of submitted data showed petroleum hydrocarbons in the gasoline, diesel and motor oil ranges present in soil above residential screening levels, along with arsenic antimony, lead, copper, cadmium, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzo(a)pyrene and benzo(a)anthracene) and volatile organic compounds (naphthalene and trimethylbenzene). Groundwater at the site contained petroleum hydrocarbons and MTBE above applicable Water Board screening levels. DTSC staff identified additional site characterization needs.    On December 14, 2021 ACDEH received notification from the DTSC that they were entering into a California Land Reuse and Revitalization Act (CLRRA) with the 5801 Christie Owner, LLC to develop and implement a Site Assessment Plan and a Response Plan if required with the intent to develop the Site with mixed use residential housing and commercial uses.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "A UST (variously reported at a 550- to 700-gallon capacity) was removed from the site on February 14, 1997.  It is reported not to have been used since the 1950’s and is also reported to have stored kerosene.  Tank bottom confirmation samples indicated up to 4,400 mg\/kg kerosene to be present in soil at 8.5 feet below grade surface (bgs).  Minimal groundwater (&lt; 5 gallons) is reported to have infiltrated into the UST excavation at a depth of 8.5 feet.  A work plan for two bores with grab groundwater sampling was submitted in January 2007.  Modifications, including collection of soil samples and two additional bore locations to help determine lateral extent, were requested in a January 2007 agency letter.  In May 2007 only two bores were placed, one in the UST pit (bore GW-01), and one approximately 10 feet southwest from the pit (bore GW-02).  No soil samples were collected.  Only soil bore GW-02 was logged.  Groundwater was encountered at a depth of approximately 14 feet bgs, and an attempt to collect groundwater between 11 – 16 feet bgs in bore GW-01 was unsuccessful.  Hydropunch grab groundwater samples were collected at 15 – 20 feet and 30 – 35 feet bgs (GW-01) and at 25 – 30 feet bgs (GW-02).  All groundwater results were nondetectable at standards limits of detection.  Documentation of manifested soil disposal is not currently available; however, a bill of lading was located that indicate 25 tons of backfill sand were imported on February 14, 1997 to backfill the excavation.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at https:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The Alameda County Environmental Health case file for Ransome Company may contain files for the other East Baybridge Center redevelopment project including the following associated cases: Bay Area Warehouse\/Santa Fe Terminal Services Area C (RO0000369), M&amp;N Warehouse (RO0003092), Clipper Exxpress, LDS, and SFTS Areas A and B (RO0003093), and the Peralta Street Right Of Way (RO0003111).    The Ransome Company site, formerly leased an approximately four and one-half- acre property within the 51-acre retail and residential redevelopment project named the East Baybridge Center (EBC).      Due to the size and history of the EBC property, Catellus Land Development Corporation (Catellus), the EBC developer, used three areas transected by Yerba Buena Avenue and Hollis Street to aid with the geographic distinction during the environmental characterization of the EBC development.  The portion of the EBC property east of Hollis Street and south of Yerba Buena Avenue was designated Area A; the area east of Hollis Street and north of Yerba Buena Avenue was designated Area B; and the area west of Hollis Street was designated Area C.  These area designations were used throughout EBC site redevelopment.  Sites occupying Area A of the EBC project consisted of Santa Fe Terminal Services (SFTS)-Area A, Clipper Exxpress warehouse, LDS warehouse, and the segment of Peralta Street between San Pablo Avenue and Emery Street.  The ownership of the Peralta Street Right Of Way (ROW) was transferred to Catellus by the City of Emeryville on April 14, 1992.  Area B of the EBC project consisted of SFTS-Area B, and the Ransome Construction Company.  Area C of the EBC project consisted of SFTS-Area C, Bashland, Bay Area Warehouse, and M and N Trucking Warehouse.  The SFTS areas were operated by the railroad company and consisted of railroad tracks and sidings and open areas for the storage of rolling stock.  Except for Peralta Street ROW and Ransome, the sites in areas A, B and C consisted of warehouse structures serviced by rail sidings alongside the buildings.  Ransome was also serviced by a rail siding but lacked a large warehouse structure.  Unimproved access roads typically paralleled the rail road tracks.    ACEH case files for the sites within the EBC development consist of RO0000049 (Ransome), RO0000326 (Bashland), RO0000369 (Bay Area Warehouse and SFTS-Area C), RO0003092 (M and N Trucking Warehouse), RO0003093 (Clipper Exxpress, LDS, and SFTS Areas A and B), and RO0003111 (Peralta Street ROW).     The property is currently owned by PAC Residential Group, Inc.  The portion of the EBC development comprising the Ransome site consists of two parcels having APNs 49-619-1 and 49-619-4 in the City of Emeryville, California.  The site as currently developed consists of Bridgecourt, four three-story structures of 220 apartments, with a parking garage on the ground floor.  End units of the residential structures consist of single story commercial suites.  The Ransome site occupied the northwestern portion of Area B within the pre-EBC development.  The approximate triangular-shaped site was situated near the southeast side of the existing Hollis and 40th Streets.  Prior to its’ existing configuration, the northern portion of 40th Street was occupied by sets of rail tracks and an access road.  The northern boundary of the Ransome site extended northward to the approximate centerline of the current 40th Street.   The western site boundary extended westward into the Hollis Street right of way.       The property was previously occupied by a Western Electric Company yard (1911).  By 1930 Hutchinson Company operated an asphalt batch plant with a concrete UST for oil storage, asphalt kettles &amp; mixer, and an asphalt tank. The Ransome Company, an engineering and construction firm, occupied the site from about 1938 in to the 1980s.  Historical operations at the Ransome facility included asphalt concrete mixing, metal working, and vehicle repair.  DTSC assessed the property (case number 01160019) in 1980 and 1987.  Ransome operated four underground storage tanks (USTs) (two 4,000-gallon diesel, one 10,000-gallon and one 1,000-gallon gasoline), two of which failed a 1988 tank pressure test.  Results of the pressure tests indicated leaks in the diesel dispenser piping and in one of the regular gasoline USTs.  Ransome also operated a partially buried waste oil tank and an above ground asphalt emulsion tank.  The site stored 55-gallon drums containing lubricants and transmission fluid for their fleet of vehicles.  Reported on-site practices included the spraying of used oil along the property perimeter and interior for weed control.  Excavation activities at the site uncovered several buried concrete vaults which were removed, broken up, and off hauled.     The four fuel USTs were removed on April 8, 1990.  In 1990 Catellus Development Corp demolished the site structures as part of the EBC redevelopment.  Site characterization work conducted in 1989 through 1992 detected maximum concentrations of 11,000 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd) to 2,700 mg\/kg, total petroleum hydrocarbons as oil (TPHo) to 4,600 mg\/kg, total oil and grease (TOG) to 17,000 mg\/kg, benzene at 100 mg\/kg, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) up to 28 mg\/kg in soil.  Grab groundwater samples detected up to 20,000 micrograms per liter (g\/L) TPHg, 12,000 g\/L TPHd, and 3,000 g\/L benzene in groundwater.      Near surface PCB-contaminated soil was encountered it the northern area of the Ransome site.  Approximately 300 cu yds of PCB contaminated soil was disposed at a US Ecology facility located 12 miles south of Beatty, Nevada off Hwy 95.  The source of PCBs at the site was not identified.  Investigation of the PCB-impacted area suggested an off-site source north of the Ransome facility.  PCB concentrations remaining in the north head wall of the excavation at the northern property boundary were 28 mg\/kg.  The location of the northern property boundary is situated at the centerline of the current 40th Street.  The PCB excavation was backfilled using imported class II AB.  PCB contamination was limited to the shallow (&lt;3 feet below the ground surface-bgs).  No PCB compounds were detected beneath the footprint of the Bridgecourt development.     Approximately 17,200 cu yds of petroleum contaminated soil was excavated between October and December 1990, with 5,480 cu yds reported placed in aeration cells located both on and off-site with another 4,100 cu yds transported to Port Costa Materials in Port Costa, CA for thermal treatment.  The balance of the excavated soil was placed in stockpiles for future placement under building pads and low-permeable paved areas in off-site EBC areas south of the Ransome site in accordance with the Soil Containment Plan prepared for the 51 acre redevelopment project.   Additional excavation work was performed in December 1991 through March 1992 with the removal of 9,600 cu yds of gasoline contaminated soil.  The soil was either stockpiled for future placement under off-site building pad and low-permeable paved areas in the soil containment area or placed in aeration cells for possible reuse on site.     Precipitation and surface runoff during winter 1991\/ 1992 resulted in episodes of water ponding in the excavation area.  The ponded water was observed to have a sheen.  Approximately 17,600 gallons of petroleum contaminated water was pumped in vacuum trucks for offsite recycling.  Clean import fill and approximately 2,500 cu yds of aerated soil meeting the cleanup criteria were used to backfill the excavations.  Residual hydrocarbon concentrations in the soil prior to backfill were 32 mg\/kg TPHg, 73 mg\/kg TPHd, benzene up to 0.35 mg\/kg, and 700 mg\/kg TOG.  The highest hydrocarbon concentrations were in the northern sidewall along the northern property boundary, within the 40th Street right-of-way.  The final verification samples showed residual soil contamination left in place met the cleanup goals with the exception of three samples collected at 10 feet along the northern property boundary.  Based on the redevelopment of the area, the residual contamination was situated near the center-line beneath 40th Street while TPH and BTEX compounds left in place beneath the footprint of the Bridgecourt development consisted of 3.3 mg\/kg TPHg, 73 mg\/kg TPHd, benzene up to 0.014 mg\/kg, and 700 mg\/kg TOG.     In October 1993, two USTs were encountered in the 40th Street-side of the Ransom site during grading activities.  One tank was a 350-gallon gasoline UST, and the other was a presumed heating oil tank.  The 350-gallon UST was removed from the site.  Sampling in the tank pit detected 330 mg\/kg TPHg, 65 mg\/kg TPHd, 480 mg\/kg TPHmo, and 77 mg\/kg TOG.  Approximately 20 cu yds of soil were removed during the over excavation of the 350-gallon UST pit.  Residual soil contamination for TOG was up to 70 mg\/kg.  TPHg, TPHd, TPHo and BTEX compounds were reported below the laboratory reporting limits.  The excavated soil was aerated and transferred to a stockpile for later placement under building pads or under low permeability paved parking.  The second UST was assumed to be a heating oil tank.  No documentation was submitted documenting the size, sampling, or fate of this oil UST.       A groundwater monitoring well (LF-8) was installed up gradient in January 1990 near the northeastern-most corner of the Ransome site.  Groundwater monitoring well (LF-16) was installed off-site down gradient in February 1990.   Three on-site groundwater monitoring wells (W-1, W-2 and W-3) were installed in November, 1990.  Results of monitoring well sampling conducted in 1990 detected up to 2,200 g\/L TPHg, 1,900 g\/L TPHd, and 270 g\/L benzene.  Monitoring wells W-1, W-2 and W-3 were decommissioned in mid-November, 1990 prior to the start of excavation of contaminated soil.    Upon completion of the excavation work, five on-site groundwater monitoring wells (LF-24 through LF-28) were installed in May 1992 with an additional on site monitoring well, LF-29, installed in October 1992.  The wells were sampled at a roughly quarterly basis until their decommissioning in July 1993 in preparation for site development.  A west-southwesterly groundwater flow was determined.  Depths to groundwater varied from 3.13 to 14.40 feet bgs.  The six on-site wells were sampled between May 1992 and July 1993.  Up to 1,000 µg\/L TPHd concentrations, 90 µg\/L TPHg, 5,600 µg\/L TOG, and benzene concentrations to 1 µg\/L were detected.  Monitoring wells LF-24 through LF-29 were decommissioned in July 1993 in preparation of site development activities.    Upon completion of grading activities onsite well MW-1 was installed in July 1994.  MW-1 was decommissioned in December 1996 prior to construction of the retail\/residential complex.  Depth to water variations for MW-1 ranged from 13.38 feet to 14.88 feet bgs with a west-southwesterly groundwater flow.  Up to 300 µg\/L TPHd was detected and TPHg and BTEX compounds were not detected.     Site cleanup levels for the Ransome site were established at 10 mg\/kg for TPHg and 100 mg\/kg for TPHd, 1,000 mg\/kg for TOG, BTEX compounds were to remain below 1 mg\/kg (cumulative) and a PCB clean up goal of 1 mg\/kg.  The site backfill criteria were 500 mg\/kg TOG, 10 mg\/kg TPHd, 10 mg\/kg TPHg, and non-detect for BTEX.  Both the cleanup and backfill criteria were met for the Bridgecourt development.

Renovations are being proposed in the basement, first and second floor, and elevator at the Site based on architectural figure obtained by ACDEH.    In February 2015, one approximately 1,500-gallon single-walled steel underground storage tank (UST) was closed in place at the Site.  The top of the UST was observed at the bottom of the tank pit\/excavation area at 10 feet below ground surface (bgs).  Shoring and bracing was used during soil removal activities as noted in the Tank Closure Report dated March 11, 2016. Based on information obtained from the tank closure environmental consultant, the UST was installed sometime in the 1930's and was filled with cement slurry in the past.  Groundwater at the site was encountered at approximately 8 to 8.5 feet bgs and the tank was noted to be submerged in groundwater during closure activities. A vacuum truck was used to dewater the excavation area during sampling activities and abandonment of associated UST piping.  Approximately 1,400 gallons of recharged groundwater were removed during dewatering activities.  The filler pipe was observed at the top of the UST (at 10 feet bgs) and noted to be cut off and cemented in place.  The delivery pipe was noted to be cut and capped.  The top back portion of the UST was observed to be in poor condition with a small visible hole which appeared to have blackish oil emitting from the hole.  The cap from the delvery pipe was removed from the top of the tank and black oil was observed inside the UST.      Hydrocarbon odors were observed in the tank excavation area following groundwater recharge and product (sheen) was observed in the excavation area. Soil and groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon as gasoline, diesel, and motor oil (TPH-g, TPH-d, and TPH-mo), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), and 5 Metals (soil only). Results of the two soil samples collected at 8 feet bgs on the northern and western sidewalls of the excavation area, respectively, indicated Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon as diesel (TPH-d) and 5 Metals (Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Nickel, and Zinc) were detected at concentrations below San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board's Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) for residential land use.     One grab groundwater sample was collected from the bottom of the excavation area after groundwater recharged at a depth of approximately 8 feet bgs. Results indicated TPH-g, TPH-d, and TPH-mo in groundwater was reported at 3,700, 1,800, and 1,200 micrograms per liter (ug\/l), respectively, at concentrations above residential ESLs.  Chloroform and Naphthalene were also detected in groundwater above residential ESLs at 2.8 ug\/l and 17 ug\/l, respectively.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This site was part of the former Westinghouse Electric Corporation (WEC) manufacturing facility that was used to repair and manufacture electrical utility equipment including transformers.  The facility operated from 1924 until 1992.  Facility operations resulted in releases of chemicals of concern to the subsurface including but not limited to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which constitute hazardous materials as defined in Health &amp; Safety Code Section 25260 of the California Code of Regulations.     Multiple agencies (United States Environmental Protection Agency - Region IX [USEPA], the Department of Toxic Substances Control [DTSC], San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board [Regional Water Board], Alameda County Department of Environmental Health [ACDEH]) are providing regulatory oversight of the investigation and cleanup of chemicals of concern. Environmental cases associated with the former WEC facility include Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0002742 and Geotracker Global ID No. T06019701198, Westinghouse Electric - Parcel 1, 5815 - 5899 Peladeau, Emeryville, ACDEH\/USEPA lead; Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0002743 and Geotracker Global ID No. SL20235853, Westinghouse Electric - Parcel 4, 5890 Horton Street, Emeryville, ACDEH\/USEPA lead; Emeryville Mound Parcel, 59th Street &amp; Horton Street, Emeryville, Envirostor No. 01360057, DTSC\/USEPA lead); and Westinghouse (Former), 6100 Horton Street, Emeryville, Getracker Global ID No. SLT2O06571, Regional Water Board lead). Corrective actions and engineering controls implemented at the former WEC facility include demolition of the facility, removal of underground storage tanks, construction of a slurry wall, excavation of PCB impacted soil and offsite disposal or consolidation beneath various soil and hardscape caps on the parcels, installation of vapor mitigation systems.    ACDEH and USEPA are currently working with the Responsible Party to evaluate the risk to the public and the environment from PCBs in soil at the site and develop appropriate engineering controls and implement institutional controls to reduce exposure risk.

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Prior to the 1930’s the site was in the San Francisco Bay; until the early 1950’s the site was a part of the City of Emeryville municipal waste landfill.  The site has been a commercial facility since at least the 1960's.  Three adjacent USTs were removed between August and October 1989 (one diesel in August, two gasoline USTs in October); black petroleum product is reported to have flowed from the south wall of the excavation adjacent to the diesel UST.  An estimated 2,000 gallons of product was removed from the excavations.  Limited overexcavation may have occurred between August 1989 and February 1990 when the excavations were backfilled; the records are unclear.  Impacts to soil and groundwater have been characterized as oil and grease, extractable hydrocarbons (TPHd), purgeable hydrocarbons (TPHg), and BTEX.  In January 1990 seven bores were installed (B-1 to B-7).  Two offsite wells (adjacent property; MW-5 and MW-7; 50 to 75 feet distant) have been used since 1989 in an attempt to help define groundwater.  The wells were sampled regularly between November 1989 and June 1997.  In June 1996 six soil bores (SB-1 to SB-6) were installed.  Preferential pathway and sensitive receptor surveys were conducted in May 2010.  Soil bores SB-7 to SB-9 were also installed to collect soil samples, and soil bores GGW-1 to GGW-4 were installed to collect grab groundwater samples.  In December 2011 four sub-slab vapor points were installed and sampled beneath the building located at the site, and at the offsite downgradient building.  An additional sub-slab vapor was collected approximately six months later in May 2012 beneath the downgradient building.  A third vapor monitoring round at the downgradient building was conducted in December 2014.    The site appears eligible for closure under the LTCP.  It meets all General Criteria.  The site qualifies for closure under Class 5 of the Groundwater Media Specific Criteria due to the presence of free product in pockets in soil in the vicinity of the former USTs.  Additionally, based on grab groundwater sample concentrations free product (LNAPL) may also be present in limited qualities in groundwater on- and offsite in close proximity to the former UST locations.  This LNAPL does not appear to be mobile based on analytical concentrations in wells MW-5 and MW-7 that are located between the former UST excavation and the downgradient offsite building.  Consequently a commercial \/ industrial land use restriction has been placed on the subject property.  Additionally a pre-existing commercial \/ industrial land use restriction was placed on the adjacent downgradient property at the time of the closure of that UST case (Emery Bay Plaza, RO0000440; T0600100511) and is expected to manage contamination at that offsite downgradient location.  The site meets the Vapor Intrusion Media Specific Criteria by Class 2c, controlling exposure by use of mitigation measures and institutional controls.  The site also meets the Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Criteria by meeting the concentrations contained in Table 1 of the LTCP.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "On September 11, 2012 one approximately 6,000-gallon single-walled steel heating oil underground storage tank (UST) was removed from the site.  Two soil samples were collected beneath the UST at a depth of 12 feet below surface grade (bgs), and four sidewall samples were collected at 4.5 or 6.0 feet bgs.  Up to 200 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd) and 360 mg\/kg TPH as motor oil (TPHmo) were detected.  Groundwater was not encountered in the UST excavation.    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP).  This site does not meet this LTCP criterion due to non-detectable Poly-Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) above LTCP Table 1 values in the 0 to 5 foot depth interval.  Although case closure is granted for the current residential land use, the former UST was located on public lands currently used as a parking lot.  Any redevelopment of the parking lot to other than current use as a parking lot, will require a re-evaluation of the residual contamination and the case.  ACDEH has made the determination that residual PAH concentrations beneath the asphalt paving at the site do not represent a direct contact health risk to residents; however, to preclude residential exposure to PAH concentrations above identified LTCP goals, should redevelopment of the parking lot occur ACDEH must be contacted in advance and site data be re-evaluated.    Case closure is granted for the current residential land use.  Due to residual subsurface contamination remaining at the site, if any redevelopment occurs, or if a change in land use to residential, or other conservative land use, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.  This site is to be entered into the City of Emeryville Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    An 8,000-gallon gasoline UST was removed from the eastern edge of the parcel in November 1994; is reported to have stored gasoline, and closure sampling is reported to have found no detectable concentrations; data to confirm this is not available.  A 2,500-gallon UST, installed between 1906 and 1912, and presumed to be a fuel oil or kerosene UST, was removed in August 1995.  Residual fuel oil was removed during the UST removal, and 54 tons of soil was excavated afterwards.  Six soil bores (B-1 to B-6) and a six-inch diameter well MW-1 \/ EW-1 were installed in November 1995.  In September 1999 three soil bores (SB-1 to SB-3) were installed near a recently discovered sump containing oily sludge near the eastern property line.  In May 2003, 10 Geoprobe bores (B-1 to B-10) were installed across the site.  In August 2005 a sump on the western portion of the site was discovered and removed during site demolition.  A third UST was discovered at the time of sump removal; however, was left in-place.  In October 2007 the third UST was removed from the site after a Geophysical survey had been conducted and relocated the UST and also found remaining product piping.  The UST appears to have held diesel and was buried at a depth of 9 feet.  In December 2007 10 soil bores (KB-1 to KB-10) were installed at the site.  Six vapor points (SV-1 to SV-6) were also installed.  In February 2009 seven CPT bores were advanced in order to help characterize the subsurface and to determine appropriate screening intervals for five monitoring wells, installed shortly after and immediately adjacent to the CPT bore locations.  One round of groundwater sampling was conducted in April 2009.",

The approximately 0.511-acre Site is currently developed with a gasoline station, which includes fuel dispenser islands with an overhead canopy. The station building includes a food mart, car wash building, restrooms; and a small trash enclosure. The remaining open areas are covered by concrete pavement, concrete pads beneath the fuel dispenser canopies, and limited landscaping along the borders. Beginning in the 1930s, non-engineered fill, consisting of debris and industrial waste, was placed to construct the peninsula where the Site is located.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The former Bay Area Warehouse (BAW) facility, located at 4001 Hollis Street, and the adjoining Santa Fe Terminal Services-Area C (SFTS-C) property, occupied an approximately eight and one-half-acre property within the 51-acre retail and residential redevelopment project named the East Baybridge Center (EBC).   The property is currently owned by East Bay Bridge Retail LLC and Toy-R-Us (TRU).  The portion of the EBC development comprising the Bay Area Warehouse consists of all or parts of five parcels having APNs 7-617-16-5, 7-617-20, and 7-617-21 in the City of Oakland, and APNs 7-617-22 and 7-617-23-1 in the City of Emeryville, California.  Current development consists of three commercial single-story structures of approximately 44,300 and 24,000, and 3,900 square feet with adjacent paved parking areas.  The site is bounded on the east by Hollis Street, on the north by Shellmound Street and 40th Street, and the south by Mandela Parkway and Yerba Buena Avenue.  The western demarcation was the former M and N Trucking warehouse facility.  As currently developed, the western property boundary for BAW\/SFTS-C is approximately along the projected extension of Hubbard Street.      Due to the size and history of the EBC property, Catellus Land Development Corporation (Catellus), the EBC project developer, used three areas transected by Yerba Buena Avenue and Hollis Street to aid with the geographic distinction during the environmental characterization of the EBC development.  The portion of the EBC property north of Yerba Buena Avenue and west of Hollis Street was designated Area C.  These area designations were used throughout site redevelopment.  Area C of the EBC project consisted of Santa Fe Terminal Services-Area C, Bashland, Bay Area Warehouse, and M and N Trucking Warehouse.  The Santa Fe Terminal Services area consisted of railroad tracks and sidings and open areas used for the storage of rolling stock.  Unimproved access roads typically paralleled the rail road tracks.  Bashland (RO0000326) and M and N Trucking Warehouse (RO0003092) facilities are not considered part of the BAW\/SFTS-C case and are addressed as separate cases.    The BAW property, as indentified in this site closure, consists of a warehouse facility and the adjoining Santa Fe Terminal Services -Area C (SFTS-C).  BAW leased the 79,000 square-foot warehouse facility from the property owner, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe (AT&amp;SF) Railway Company.  SFTS-C was included with the contiguous BAW as it bounds BAW on the south and west (down groundwater gradient) of the BAW warehouse underground storage tank (UST) location, providing groundwater monitoring data, and contained a 60-gallon tank possibly used for heating oil storage.   The BAW facility consisted of a 79,000 square-foot warehouse, access road and rail road sidings, and a paved parking area.  Prior to the existing commercial development, a warehouse structure, constructed in 1903, was situated in the north-central portion of the property.  The warehouse was originally occupied by the Western Electric Company.  The warehouse was serviced by a railroad spur along the north side of the building.  The facility was accessed by an asphalt paved road trending westward from Hollis Street.  The warehouse was occupied by the Furniture Corporation of America by the 1930s.  Site operations were reported to include spray painting, finishing, and paint storage.  The original building was expanded and in 1951 was occupied by an oil house, truck washing, and beer warehouse.  An incinerator was located in the northwest corner of the building at this time.  In 1964 the western end of the building was occupied by a metal shelving warehouse with the remainder of the warehouse building occupied by Bay Cities Warehouse.  Later tenants included a vending machine company, two chemical companies, and a rubber manufacturing company. The chemical and rubber companies were reported to have used the facility for storage.  Wellson, Inc, doing business as the Bay Area Warehouse Company, leased the warehouse facility by the late 1970s.  The BAW warehouse was  serviced by railroad sidings along the northern and southern perimeters of the elongate warehouse building and was used as a storage and transfer point for a variety of dry goods and limited quantities of hazardous materials that included oxides and acids.  A 2,000-gallon underground gasoline storage tank was associated with the warehouse.     The southern and western portion of the property (SFTS-C) consisted of railroad tracks, sidings and open paved and unpaved areas. Early usage of the area south of the BAW warehouse was for coal storage by the American Fuel Company.  Subsequently paved areas of SFTS-C were used by the Santa Fe Terminal Services for the storage of truck trailers.  With the reduction\/cessation of track usage, the southern site area became a dumping ground for trash and demolition debris.      Soil and groundwater investigations conducted in 1990 revealed the presence of toluene concentrations of up to 0.54 mg\/kg in soil.  Total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), and total petroleum hydrocarbons as oil (TPHo) were reported at levels below the laboratory detection limit for both soil and groundwater samples recovered from the property.  Arsenic, lead, and zinc concentrations were detected at 22 mg\/kg, 240 mg\/kg, and 420 mg\/kg, respectively in the upper half-foot of the southwestern site area and arsenic at 25 mg\/kg in the southeastern site area.  The lead and zinc concentrations decreased to 5 mg\/kg and 38 mg\/kg, respectively, by four feet below the ground surface.  Two metals were documented in site groundwater- the presence of nickel, at up to 50 µg\/L, and zinc concentrations up to 21 µg\/L.  A subsequent investigation was conducted in 1991 to address oily soil and groundwater observed in a test pit opposite the abutting Bashland facility USTs.   TPHo was reported to 1,100 mg\/kg and TPHd to 1 mg\/kg.  Excavating was halted to prevent undermining the Bashland USTs.  The report recommended continuing excavation activities after the Bashland USTs were removed.  No documentation regarding additional excavation work was found in the case file. However, the 1,100 mg\/kg TPHo concentration s below the 2013 Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) 2,500 mg\/kg residual fuels Environmental Screening Level (ESL) for shallow soils where groundwater is a potential source of drinking water, commercial land use scenario.    On November 20, 1991 one 2,000-gallon single walled, tar-coated-steel gasoline UST of unknown age and 20 feet of piping were removed from the BAW facility.  A sample of the contents of the tank was recovered for identification and was identified as leaded gasoline with trace amounts of weathered diesel.  Approximately 10 gallons of residual product was pumped out and transported off site for disposal.  The base of the tank was at 6 feet below the ground surface with ground water encountered at approximately 6 feet.  A visual inspection of the removed tank did not reveal signs of rupture, puncture, cracking or leakage.  Approximately 30 cubic yards (cu-yds) of soil were excavated and stockpiled during the tank removal.  Three soil samples, two from the UST excavation and one from beneath the former dispenser island, and one groundwater sample were recovered for analysis.  All samples were analyzed for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, total xylenes and lead.   The soil samples were reported to contain concentrations of up to 3.0 mg\/kg TPHg, 0.013 mg\/kg toluene, 0.052 mg\/kg ethylbenzene, and 0.057 mg\/kg total xylenes.  Benzene levels were reported below the 0.005 mg\/kg laboratory detection limit.  Lead was reported at concentrations up to 146 mg\/kg.  A waste extraction test (WET) was performed on the sample with the 146 mg\/kg lead result.  The WET lead was reported at 21.7 mg\/L (the analytical laboratory reported the concentration units as mg\/kg).  Groundwater entering the tank pit was observed to have a sheen on the water surface.  The groundwater sample recovered from the excavation contained TPHg at 8,800 micrograms\/liter (µg\/L), 240 µg\/L benzene, 360 µg\/L toluene, 170 µg\/L ethylbenzene, and 750 µg\/L total xylenes.  The lead concentration in the water sample was reported to be below the laboratory detection limit.       A 60-gallon UST was encountered on September 8, 1994 during an exploration of areas exhibiting magnetic anomalies.  A profile sample of the liquid contents of the tank revealed TPHg, TPHd, and TPHo at 0.09 mg\/kg, 2 mg\/kg, and 2 mg\/kg, respectively.  The BTEX compound concentrations were reported below their respective laboratory detection limits.  Excavation sampling indicated residual soil concentrations of 2 mg\/kg TPHg, 3 mg\/kg TPHd, and 20 mg\/kg TPHo.  Based on the results of soil sampling, the UST was presumed to be a thing oil tank.  The 20 cu-yds of soil removed from the excavation were returned to the tank pit as backfill.  The 20 gallons of liquid pumped from the tank was introduced into a groundwater treatment system operating in different area of the EBC development.    In September and October 1994 oil-affected soil was excavated from within the Yerba Buena Street right-of-way on SFTS-C.  The soil was encountered during grading\/site development activities and contained up to 390 mg\/kg TPHd and 2,100 mg\/kg total oil and grease (TOG).  The TPHd sample was flagged by the laboratory as due to the presence of a heavier petroleum hydrocarbon in the C18-C36 range (possibly motor oil).  Approximately 300 cu yds of soil containing concentrations exceeding the cleanup guidelines was excavated and transported to the REMCO facility in Richmond, California for thermal treatment and recycled for use as backfill material within the EBC project area. Confirmation soil samples from the over-excavation demonstrated the maximum residual concentrations as 4 mg\/kg TPHd, 30 mg\/kg TPHo and 80 mg\/kg TOG.    Perimeter up gradient groundwater monitoring wells LF-9, LF-10, and LF-11 were installed in January and February 1990 to monitor for off-site impacts in groundwater entering the site.  Well LF-11 was decommissioned and replaced by monitoring well LF-11R in the Fall, 1993.  Groundwater monitoring well LF-32 was installed on May 20, 1993 adjacent to the down gradient side of the former 2,000-gallon UST.  Diesel range petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHd) were reported in all five of the LF-32 quarterly monitoring events performed between May 1993 and June 1994 during which TPHd was analyzed.  Concentrations of TPHd were reported at 230 µg\/L to 1,400 µg\/L.    Oil range petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHo) were reported in the three quarterly monitoring events during which TPHo was analyzed, with concentrations varying from 360 µg\/L to 850 µg\/L.  Gasoline range petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHg) were reported in one of six quarterly monitoring events at a concentration of 110 µg\/L.  The analytical laboratory flagged the gasoline sample as primarily due to the presence of a heavier petroleum hydrocarbon product of hydrocarbon range C9-C14, possibly a diesel fuel.  Subsequently, the laboratory indicated the TPHg detected was the result of cross contamination by the laboratory.  The well was re-sampled and analyzed for TPHg with the result of a TPHg concentration reported below the laboratory reporting limit, supporting laboratory contamination determination.  The BTEX compounds were reported below the laboratory reporting limits for the five of the quarterly monitoring events during which the BTEX compounds were analyzed.      Monitoring wells LF-10, LF-11 and LF-32 were decommissioned in June 1994 in preparation for site grading activities.  Monitoring well LF-9 had previously been decommissioned in June, 1991.  Monitoring well LF-32 was replaced by well MW-32R in late 1995.  MW-32R similarly situated down gradient of the former UST location and was within 20 feetof the well it replaced.  Monitoring well MW-32R was sampled approximately quarterly through February 1997.  Monitoring well LF-10 was replaced by MW-10R.  Well MW-10R continued to provide off-site VOC data but was moved in part to be out of the widened 40th Street right-of-way.  During the final year of sampling the maximum reported concentration in the wells included 350 µg\/L TPHd.  The TPHg and BTEX compound concentrations were also reported below their respective laboratory detection limits.  The replacement wells were decommissioned in March, 2004.   Depth to water (dtw) measurements ranged from 5.53 feet to 7.39 feet btoc between December 1995 and  the final groundwater sampling event in December 2001.      Site cleanup criteria were established at 1,000 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) total oil and grease (TOG), 100 mg\/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), 10 mg\/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and 1 mg\/kg benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene or toluene (BTEX) compounds (combined).  A 1992 revision to the clean up levels reduce the benzene concentration to non-detect.  The Total Threshold Limit Concentrations (TTLCs) were used for the cleanup levels for metals.  Soils containing concentration exceedances were either disposed off-site, excavated and placed in an off-site soil containment area located in another area within the EBC development , or addressed during mass grading activities.      Though no on-site source areas of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been identified at the site, VOCs have historically been detected in groundwater and in soil at the soil-groundwater interface beneath the greater EBC project area.  Based on the findings of the soil and groundwater studies, the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) was of the opinion VOCs in groundwater appear to be from an off-site up-gradient source.  The RWQCB was the lead agency for VOC impacts to groundwater for the EBC project (RWQCB Case #01S0226) and are not considered a part of this closure.  The RWQCB closed their VOC case on June 6, 2002.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The former fire station was part of a residential redevelopment plan that was not successful proceed.  Apparently a subsequent redevelopment plan was successful; however, ACDEH has no documentation of redevelopment related work.  As a part of this later redevelopment, the parcel the former fire station was on was merged into a larger parcel and the area of the former fire station was converted to an asphalt covered parking lot in a larger redevelopment that included a Longs Drug Store (now CVS) further to the north on the parcel.    Site investigation activities were conducted between 1994 and 2018 to evaluate the extent of subsurface impacts both on and offsite to soil and groundwater from the release.  Site investigation activities included excavation sidewall sampling, installation of three monitoring wells MW-1 (subsequently lost) through MW-3, and installation of five direct-push boreholes (SB-1 through SB-5).  After the removal of the 500 or 1,000-gallon diesel UST, soil samples were collected from each of the four sidewalls of the UST excavation pit at the depth of seven feet bgs.  In addition, a soil sample was also collected from the base of excavation pit at the fuel dispenser island at 3 ft bgs.  The five soil samples were analyzed for TPHg, TPHd, and BTEX.  A groundwater monitoring well (MW-1) was installed approximately 10 feet downgradient of the former UST to a depth of 23 feet bgs in February 1995.  The well was monitored quarterly for one year for TPHg, TPHd, and BTEX.     Well MW-1 appears to have been lost or destroyed during the site redevelopment in the early 2000s by the site developer; however, documentation of its destruction is unavailable.  Under the direction of ACDEH, two direct-push boreholes (SB-1 and SB-2) were installed to a depth of 25 feet bgs in October 2016 to establish post-redevelopment site conditions.  Soil samples were collected from 4-4.5 ft bgs, 9.5-10 ft bgs, 13-13.5 ft bgs and 22-22.5 ft bgs and were analyzed for TPHg, TPHd, TPHmo and VOCs.    Subsequently, three boreholes (SB-3 through SB-5) and two monitoring wells (MW-2 and MW-3) were installed as a part of a data gap investigation activity in 2018.  The monitoring wells were analyzed for TPHg, TPHd, CAM5 metals, semi volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).    At the time of case closure the site was located within a redeveloped parcel block and is predominately located in the southern area of a parking lot for the CVS Pharmacy Store to the north, and in the northern area of a parking lot contiguous with the retail redevelopment to the south.  There are no known plans to redevelop the parcels.    This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  ACDEH determined that the site met all the LTCP General Criteria and Media Specific Criteria and therefore poses a low risk to human health and safety and the environment.  The determination was based on receptors and environmental conditions identified at and in the vicinity of the site at the time of closure and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios.",

In March 1989, four 50-gallon underground storage tanks (USTs) used to store fuel oil were removed; sampling revealed the presence of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) in the shallow groundwater in the vicinity of the USTs area. The peak concentrations for TCE and PCE were approximately 550 ug\/L and 110 ug\/L at MW11 and MW10, in 1991 and 1992. Pollutant concentrations in groundwater decreased and wells were destroyed.    In 1992 the former facility was torn down. In 1996 Pixar Studios purchased the Del Monte property and later properties around it, including the former Castle Property, Emery Street right-of-way, 4240 and 4250 Hollis St (now 1200 Park Av). Activities at 4240 and 4250 Hollis St property included machine repair and storage of oil. Laboratory results indicated presence of lead based paint (LBP). The Site underwent two phases of redevelopment activities from 1998 through 2011. Six underground storage tanks (USTs) were discovered during the excavation of a utility and storm drain drench; removed in May of 2009. Also, during the excavation were found buried railroad tracks; removed and disposed according to a site risk management plans (RMPs). A park, parking lot and a commercial office building now exist on the site. Currently, following up on post-construction risk management measures and soil vapor assessment.",

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The subject site is one of seven sites with a co-mingled soil and groundwater contaminant plumes sites (Oakland National Engravers; RO0000079; Dunne Quality Paints; RO0000073; San Francisco French Bread Company; RO0000171; Celis Service Station; RO0000453; SNK Andante; RO0002530; Oak Walk; RO0002733, and Magnolia Terrace; RO0003004).  The groundwater contaminant plume extends a minimum distance of approximately 1,200 feet in length (see attached paleochannel figure).  The soil and groundwater plumes appear to have moved through a series of granular paleochannels (with significant interconnectivity) that is present beneath the sites.    The subject site has contributed to residual contamination at the Oak Walk site (RO0002733) and to the SNK Andante site (RO0002530).  Two USTs were removed in May 1989 and confirmation soil samples detected significantly elevated levels of hydrocarbon contamination in soil. Groundwater monitoring wells were installed in July 1992 to evaluate the dissolved phase plume. This site is considered to be part of Oak Walk Redevelopment (RO0002733), which has been redeveloped as residential condominium and townhouse housing units and commercial retail space.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This Post-Closure Case has been opened to act as a document repository for administering, implementing and enforcing institutional controls recorded for the Property due to subsurface contamination.     Soil, soil vapor, and\/or groundwater at the Property has been contaminated from historic land use and operations, including an oxygen supply, furniture manufacturing, and refrigeration supply companies, as well as adjacent land-use .  These operations resulted in contamination of soil, soil vapor and\/or groundwater with the following primary chemicals of concern: carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethene, trichloroethene, cis-1,2-dichloroethene, trans-1,2-dichloroethene, chloroform, petroleum constituents (including total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline, diesel, and motor oil, naphthalene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes and naphthalene), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and lead. The risk of public exposure to chemicals of concern in the subsurface at the Property has been lessened by the implementation of institutional and engineering controls. Without these institutional and engineering controls, public exposure could take place via direct contact with soil and groundwater, and inhalation of vapors which could potentially migrate to indoor air from the subsurface.    Institutional controls at the Property consist of a Covenant and Environmental Restriction on Property (Land Use Covenant or LUC), dated August 8, 2019 that was recorded for the Property on August 8, 2019, in the Official Records of Alameda County, California as Document No. 2019154281 and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) dated  August 8, 2019 that documents the requirements for long-term management of the Property in accordance with the LUC and land use restrictions based on environmental conditions at the Property to mitigate risks and reduce\/minimize exposure to construction workers, occupants, and other users and governs any future occupancy, modifications\/redevelopment, and maintenance of the property.    Engineering controls at the Property include the asphalt and concrete cap consisting of the paved areas and building foundations (the \"Capped Area\" or CAP) existing a the time of recordation of the LUC. The CAP provides a barrier to eliminate potential exposure to chemicals of concern in soil, soil vapor, and groundwater at the Property. A Soil Vapor Monitoring Well Network consisting of 17 subslab vapor pins and two soil gas vapor probes is installed with the Capped Area to monitor soil vapor conditions beneath the building foundations and paved areas.    At the time of recordation of the Land Use Covenant and preparation of the RMP, the 0.49 acre Property was improved with an unoccupied approximately 12,220 square foot two story commercial office\/warehouse without an operational heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, a 1,500 square foot shed, and adjacent paved and landscaped areas. Modifications to this Property configuration and building envelope(s) may create new exposure pathways to chemicals of concern in the subsurface and invalidate the human health risk evaluations conducted at the site.    Therefore, the following redevelopment and construction activities are prohibited at the Property unless expressly permitted in writing by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH):    Modifications to the Capped Areas (paved areas and building foundations)  Modifications to the Soil Vapor Monitoring Well Network  Modifications to the building envelope(s)  Installation of HVAC systems  Installation of groundwater dewatering systems  Installation of new subsurface utilities    Prior to occupancy of site building(s) (whether in its existing configuration or in a modified configuration) the Property Owner must submit a Soil Vapor and Indoor Air Monitoring Plan to ACDEH for review and approval and the work implemented demonstrating that the building(s) are safe for human occupancy a minimum of 30 days prior to building occupancy.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker. Additional documents can be viewed over the Internet on the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health website (http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm). Both databases should be reviewed to obtain a complete history.    Fuel Leak Case No Case No. RO0000071 was opened by ACDEH in 1993 to investigate an unauthorized release from a gasoline underground storage tank (UST) that was removed from the site in 1989.     Investigation activities were conducted in 1994 to evaluate the extent of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination impacts to soil and groundwater from the gasoline UST release.  The investigations included installation of five soil bores (SB-A through SB-E) and one groundwater monitoring well (C-2) in the vicinity and downgradient of the former tank pit for the collection of soil and groundwater samples to delineate the extent of the release and evaluate risk to human health and the environment.  Additional soil bores (13, 14, HA8 through HA11) advanced as part of a separate investigation of subsurface contamination on the adjacent property provide additional data delineating the extent of the gasoline UST release at the site.     Additional subsurface investigations have also been conducted at the site from 1994 to present to delineate the extent of petroleum and non-petroleum contamination that has been identified at the site associated with historic fill material contaminant migration from the adjacent property located at 5800 Christie Avenue.  The investigations have included installation of additional soil bores, groundwater monitoring wells, and soil\/sub-slab vapor monitoring points for the collection of soil, soil and soil vapor. In 2017 a separate Site Cleanup Program Case (RO 0003267) was opened to bifurcate investigation of the contamination associated with the gasoline UST release investigated in 1994 from the petroleum and non-petroleum contamination identified at the site.    This UST release case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH has determined that the site meets all the LTCP General Criteria and the Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater. The site does not meet the LTCP Media Specific Criteria for Vapor Intrusion and Outdoor Air due to shallow groundwater that limits a bioattnuation zone to less than 5 feet and precludes the collection of soil vapor data. However, petroleum volatile organic compounds, including naphthalene, in soil and groundwater samples in the vicinity of the former UST were non-detect or detected at trace concentrations and indicate that residual contamination from the gasoline UST release at the site does not pose a vapor intrusion risk at the site or downgradient of the site.  This site also does not meet the Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Media-Specific Criteria due to the lack of analysis in soil for naphthalene at the former gasoline UST location.  However, the maximum concentration of TPHg documented in tank excavation spoils at the site was reported to be 23 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) in a four-way composite sample. The LUFT manual indicates that naphthalene is present at an average of 0.25% and a maximum of 0.36% in fresh gasoline product.  Assuming a four-fold reduction due to compositing, the data indicates that naphthalene may be present at a concentration up to 0.29 mg\/kg at the site, which is below the Table 1 criteria for a commercial land use and construction worker exposure.  Additionally, under the current land use scenario the direct contact exposure pathways is incomplete as the site is covered with buildings and hardscape.     Other than removal of the UST, no remediation was conducted at the Site. Due to residual petroleum hydrocarbon subsurface contamination, the site has been closed with site management requirements. Referto the Case Closure Summary in the case file for more information on the site management requirements.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The property at 1240 Powell Street is currently developed as an office space.  Surrounding properties are commercial along Powell street and residential in the surrounding areas.  Near surface soils consist of clays with varying amounts of sands and gravel to a depth of 10 to 14 feet below ground surface (fbgs), underlain by a layer of stiff clay with less gravel.  Under the clays is a clay-rich sand beginning at 14 to 16 fbgs.    A 4,000 gallon gasoline tank and piping were removed from the property on November 22, 1991.  There were no holes or evidence of corrosion on the underground storage tank (UST).  There was also no overspill protection devices associated with the UST.  Two soil samples were collected from the east and west walls of the tank excavation at approximately nine fbgs.  A four-point composite sample was also collected from the soil stockpiled on site.  Analytical results of the soil samples revealed that there was no TPHg, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, or xylenes (BTEX). Lead was detected in the soil sample from the eastern wall of the excavation and in the stockpile sample at concentrations of 5.5 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) and 4.96 mg\/kg, respectively.  The soil was utilized to partially backfill the UST excavation.    A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) was subsequently performed in December 2001.  Investigation of past uses of the property revealed that the site was a gasoline service station from the late 1950s through 1974.  The site previously had two 6,000 gallon fuel USTs, one 2,000 gallon fuel UST, one 550 gallon waste oil UST, and one 10,000 gallon fuel UST.  One of the 6,000 gallon USTs was replaced in 1969 with the 10,000 gallon UST.  Otherwise, all remaining USTs were removed in 1974 when the gasoline station was demolished.  The 4,000 gallon UST, installed after 1974, was removed in November 1991, and had been was used to fuel delivery trucks.  Based on a lack of soil sampling data (except for the 4,000 gallon UST) the ESA indicated that a potential for petroleum contamination existed at the site.  Eight soil borings (SB-1 through SB-8) were advanced on February 7, 2002 to determine if the site had been impacted with petroleum hydrocarbons from past use of onsite USTs.  The soil borings were advanced to depths between 12 and 20 fbgs, depending on where saturated soils were encountered.  Groundwater was encountered in all borings except SB-7 at depths between 6 and 17 fbgs.  TPHg and TPHd were only detected in soil sample SB-1 8’ at concentrations of 47 mg\/kg and 5.8 mg\/kg, respectively.  No BTEX, oil and grease, or VOCs were detected in any soil sample.  The grab groundwater samples contained  maximum concentrations of 1,400 micrograms per liter (µg\/l) TPHg, 1,400 µg\/l TPHd, 5.7 µg\/l methyl tertiary butyl ether, 5.7 µg\/l benzene, 3.0 µg\/l toluene, 5.2 µg\/l ethylbenzene, 4.0 µg\/l xylenes, and 5.1 µg\/l 1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCA).  Please note that the associated report does not contain the laboratory analytical report and these data cannot be otherwise verified.    On August 2, 2002, three soil borings were advanced and converted to 20 foot deep groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-3).   Soil samples were collected at approximately every five feet in each boring.  Groundwater samples were collected from the wells after development; there were no detectable hydrocarbons (TPHg, TPHd, BTEX, or MTBE) in any of the soil samples.  TPHd was detected in the groundwater samples collected from MW-2 and MW-3 at concentrations of 81 and 130 µg\/l, respectively.   No TPHg or BTEX was detected in any groundwater samples.  No detectable concentrations of VOCs were detected.  MTBE was detected in well MW-2, at a concentration of 5.1 µg\/l.   Please notethat the associated report contains a laboratory analytical report from a later October 27, 2004 groundwater monitoring event, and these reported analytical data cannot be otherwise verified.    On April 14, 2010, two soil borings were advanced to investigate the site.  Soil bore B-1 was installed downgradient of well MW-1 and several former UST locations to investigate the depth of groundwater and to determine if the well screen intervals were appropriate to evaluate dissolved phase groundwater contamination beneath the site.  Groundwater was reported to not have been encountered to a depth of 16 fbgs; however, indications of the presence of shallow groundwater were present.  Soil bore B-2 was installed in the vicinity of the former waste oil UST to evaluate waste oil contaminants beneath the site.  Groundwater was again not encountered to a depth of 16 fbgs.  Soil samples were collected from bores B-1 and B-2 at the depths of 9 and 8 fbgs, respectively, based on the depth of groundwater in the closest well to the soil bore locations.  A concentration of 59 mg\/kg TPHg, and 9.8 mg\/kg TPHd, and 0.17 mg\/kg total xylenes were detected in soil bore B-1.  Additionally several Semi-Volatile Compounds (SVOCs) were detected in soil bore B-1.  TPH as motor oil, Oil and Grease, VOCs, PCBs, and Semi-Volatile Compounds (SVOCs) were non-detectable in B-2.  No SVOCs were detected in B-2.  The detected SVOC compounds (n-butyl benzene [0.47 mg\/kg], sec-butyl benzene [0.28 mg\/kg], and n-propyl benzene [0.44] mg\/kg) do not have an associated RWQCB Environmental Screening Level (ESL); however, a brief risk assessment was conducted using conservative assumptions.  A Hazard Index (HI) of 0.000016 was calculated, and no apparent risk is therefore presumed.    Groundwater monitoring has been conducted in the three monitoring wells on four dates between 2002 and 2009.  Total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) and total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd) have both historically been detected at a maximum concentration of 1,400 µg\/l in a grab groundwater sample collected from SB-2 near the southeast corner of the site.  As of the most recent monitoring event, 1,2- dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) is the only remaining contaminant, detected in monitoring wells MW-2 and MW-3 at concentrations of 4.8 and 4.0 µg\/l, respectively.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site covers an area approximately 220 feet by 500 feet and is bound by Hollis Street to the east, 59th Street to the north, Peladeau Street to the west, and a Chevron Station and Powell Street to the south.  The site is currently occupied by a six-story office and biomedical laboratory building with one level of subsurface parking and one level of at-grade parking.  The building occupies the majority of the Site.  Excavation for the subsurface parking required excavation across most of the Site to approximately 15-feet below ground surface (bgs).    Prior to 1917 the site appeared to have been a vacant lot.  The site was historically owned (1917 to 1964) and operated by Union Oil Company of California as a petroleum products distribution facility.  The adjacent Chevron Service Station property (1400 Powell Street; RO0000067) to the south was also on the Union Oil distribution facility.  Operations included numerous above-ground and underground petroleum hydrocarbon storage tanks.  Up to 40,000 gallons of lubricating oil were reportedly stored in aboveground tanks.  The site also consisted of a garage along Hollis Street and an auto repair shop along Peladeau Street.  Between 1964 and 1974 the Intermountain Terminal Company owned the parcel.  In 1985 the Marks management Company purchased the majority of the property.  The property, as the Emeryville Industrial Court, subsequently appears to have been leased to multiple tenants.  Hazardous materials reported to have been associated with these businesses included, among other incidental chemicals, paints, thinners, lacquers, inks, solvents (1,1,1-TCA and methylene chloride), oil storage drums (new and used), drummed used oil filters, one 1,000-gallon used motor oil AST, and one 10,000-gallon gasoline UST.  The UST is reported to have been in the “front yard” of 5805 Hollis and is reported to have been removed in 1990.  No records are reported to be available for that event; however, the property owners of the parcel reported that soil contamination was noted and was disposed of at a regulated landfill.    Construction near the site in the 1980s and 1990s revealed soil and groundwater impacted with petroleum hydrocarbons.  The widening of 59th Street in 1999 at the north end of the parcel, and on to the historic Union Oil parcel, documented shallow contamination at concentrations of TPHd up to 13,000 mg\/kg, TPHo up to 15,000 mg\/kg, lead up to 120 mg\/kg, and PCBs up to 0.092 mg\/kg.  Significant decreases in contamination are documented by a depth of 4 feet at these now offsite locations.  These materials are reported to have been overexcavated and disposed offsite.    The site is primarily underlain by fine-grained material with thin lenses of course-grained material.  The stiffness of this primarily fine-grained material tends to increase with depth.  Groundwater has been measured at approximately 6 to 14 feet bgs in borings.  Some perched water, which may have originated in the coarse-grained backfill of utility trenches, was observed entering the excavation during construction of the building.  Groundwater flow has been observed at nearby sites towards the west (San Francisco Bay) with slight north and south variations.    In 2000 and 2005, Treadwell &amp; Rollo conducted pre-construction environmental sampling of soil and groundwater at the site.  This consisted of the installation of 18 soil bores (TR-1 to TR-18) in 2000 to a depth of 15 feet bgs, and the installation of soil bores TR-19 to TR-31 in 2005 to average depths of 7 to 9 feet bgs, but with three bores extending to 13 feet bgs.  Results of the sampling event were used to prepare a Site Management Plan (SMP) dated July 14, 2005 for use during construction.  In August 2005 soil bores TR-33 to TR-38 were installed to a depth of 15 feet bgs within the site boundaries to further investigate contamination.  Bore TR-32 was not installed due to surface obstructions, and bores TR-33 to TR-38 were not logged due to installation in close proximity to previous bore locations.  Thirty dewatering wells were then installed around the property perimeter to a depth of approximately 20 feet bgs to provide construction dewatering of the property.  Post-excavation confirmation sampling was performed in May 2006 in general conformity with the approved SMP, and included the collection of confirmation soil samples TR-39 to TR-56 around the perimeter and at the base of the excavation, and the collection of groundwater data at selected dewatering locations (wells DW-11, DW-14, and DW-24).  Concentrations up to 10 mg\/kg TPHg, 7.9 mg\/kg TPHd (both with non-standard chromatograms), and 33 mg\/kg TPHmo were detected in soil.  A concentration of 0.40 mg\/kg TBA and 0.0082 mg\/kg benzene was detected in soil at the southern end of the excavation, within approximately 20 feet of the adjacent Chevron service station.  Up to 0.220 mg\/kg methylene chloride was detected in four soil samples along the eastern property boundary, proximal to a previous use area; however, the laboratory also issued a letter stating that these may be a laboratory contaminant and indicated the lab had sporadic detections of this compound in the refrigerated sample storage area during that time period.  Up to 0.60 mg\/kg benzo(a)pyrene were detected in four soil samples along the western property boundary.    In July 2008 soil bore TR-GW was installed at the southwestern corner of the subject site to collect a grab groundwater sample in an effort to determine the source of groundwater contamination in the vicinity of dewatering well DW-14.  Concentrations of 430 µg\/l TPHg, 560 µg\/l TPHd, 3.8 µg\/l benzene, and 13 µg\/l EDC (as well as other compounds) were detected.  The detection of EDC was suggested to indicate contamination was emanating from the adjacent Chevron service station.  MTBE was not detected in these samples at standard detection limits.  Based on the results of the 2000 and 2005 investigations, additional post-construction investigations of benzo(a)pyrene along the western property boundary, of potential volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater from an identified historical storage area along the eastern property boundary, and of residual total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in the southwestern portion of the site be undertaken.  The TPH investigation was coordinated with the hydrocarbon related investigation activities at the adjacent property to the south (the referenced Chevron site at 1400 Powell Street).  In March and April 2010 hand augered soil bores HA-1 to HA-4 (to investigate shallow soil at landscaping depths) and CPT bores TRCPT-1 to TRCPT-4 (to investigate deeper and offsite soil and groundwater) were installed to investigate the benzo(a)pyrene and VOC issues, and CPT bores TRCPT-5 to TRCPT-9 were installed to investigate the TPH issue.  The investigation did not detect additional benzo(a)pyrene and VOC concentrations of concern.  TPH compounds were detected in shallow soil and shallow groundwater samples in the southern portion of the site (in soil up to 690 mg\/kg TPHg, 220 mg\/kg TPHd, 80 mg\/kg TPHmo, 4 mg\/kg ethylbenzene, and 4.9 mg\/kg naphthalene at 5 to 6 feet bgs).  TPH compounds were not detected in deeper soil samples collected at the site (10 to 22 ft bgs).  Residual TPH contamination remains in soil along the southern property line at concentrations up to 2,100 mg\/kg TPHg, 140 mg\/kg TPHd (both with non-standard chromatograms), and 280 mg\/kg TPHmo (however BTEX was not analyzed in these January 2005 samples).    Chevron Corporation, the owner of the southern service station portion of the former Union Bulk Storage facility, appears to be the apparent source of the majority of soil and groundwater contamination at the southern end of the subject parcel.  Chevron continues to operate the gasoline station immediately adjacent to the site at Powell Street, and is currently investigating groundwater contamination at and around that facility (RO0000067).",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Eight USTs were installed beneath the sidewalk at the site between 1930 and 1965, and substances stored included diesel, fuel oil, waste oil, aqueous ammonia, gasoline, and denatured alcohol.  Thirteen soil bores were installed adjacent to the USTs prior to abandonment in-place in August 1994.  The waste oil, diesel, and ammonia USTs showed evidence of leakage.  Two wells were installed in September 1994 adjacent to the diesel and gasoline USTs.  Groundwater was sampled once in September 1994, and then again over four consecutive quarters between late 1999 and late 2000.  Groundwater wells MW-3 and MW-4 were installed in 2012 and define the downgradient and lateral extent of the dissolved-phase hydrocarbon plume.    Groundwater monitoring since 2009 appears to indicate a stable or declining groundwater plume.  An onsite water supply well, was lost during site redevelopment in 2000.  The well is estimated to have been located within 15 feet of well MW-4, which for three quarters was non-detect for all petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants present at the site in 2012 and 2013.  This lost well causes the site to fail the groundwater media-specific criteria of the LTCP; however, because data indicates that the well was relatively shallow, it does not appear to represent a significant threat to groundwater quality at the site.  Should it be found in the future, the well will be required to be properly destroyed under permit by the Alameda County Public Works Agency, or successor organizations.    Due to the lack of shallow soil samples in the 0 to 5 foot depth interval, by which to comprehensively evaluate the threat of vapor intrusion or direct contact under the LTCP, the site was evaluated using alternative site data.  Using the alternative information (See closure and LTCP checklist) the site was closed under the LTCP with a commercial land use restriction.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "According to the case file and the Alameda County Assessor’s Office, the Site is comprised of a single parcel (Assessor’s Parcel Number 49-1315-1) with a total size of 0.53 acres and is currently owned by Watertower Associates LLC. Current improvements to the Site reportedly consist of an approximately 10,000-square foot single-story commercial building located along the eastern edge of the property and a water tower located in the northwest corner of the property. Ground cover at the Site consists of asphalt with some limited landscaping in the northern portion of the Site. The site is currently occupied by Becherer Kannett &amp; Schweitzer (the Responsible Party) and is utilized as office space for the law firm of the Responsible Party. Land use in the vicinity of the Site consists of multifamily residential and commercial land use. The Site is bound to the south by a park, the east by Beaudry Street, the north by Powell Street, and the west by Doyle Street. ACDEH has not been made aware of any planned changes in land use or redevelopment activities at, or in the immediate vicinity of, the Site.    The Site is currently regulated by ACDEH under the authority of a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement (VRAA) entered into by ACDEH and Becherer Kannett &amp; Schweitzer who is reportedly authorized as a signor for the property owner. Recognized environmental conditions identified at the Site include (1) the historic on-site presence of a 2,000-gallon and two 10,000-gallon petroleum underground storage tanks (USTs), which were removed in 1969; (2) on-site fill material contaminated with lead; and (3) Operations of an analytical laboratory, Brown &amp; Caldwell, from 1978 to 1993. At this time, based on historic land use and the results of previously subsurface investigations at the Site, constituents of concern (COCs) for the Case include petroleum hydrocarbons, lead, and laboratory associated solvents and volatile organic compounds, specifically acetone and chloroform.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is located in a mixed residential and commercial area of Emeryville and is currently developed as multi-story residential units consisting of one parcel APN: 12-953-34.  During advancement of tree wells associated with the redevelopment of the Site in November 2015, one approximately 575-gallon single-walled heating oil underground storage tank (UST) was discovered adjacent to 39th Street and directly beneath a 6-inch diameter East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) water pipe.  The bottom of the UST was observed at 7 feet below ground surface (bgs). No associated piping (vent, etc) was observed during removal activities.  The UST was reported to be in poor condition with visible holes and hydrocarbon odors in the tank excavation area.  Groundwater was not encountered during tank removal activities.    Prior to tank removal approximately 30-gallons of residual petroleum were removed from the UST and approximately 700-gallons of rainwater was removed from the tree well which had accumulated during a previous rain event.    Following tank removal activities soil was excavated from the bottom of the UST pit to a depth of approximately 9 feet bgs.  Limited excavation was conducted on the western portion of the tank pit floor due to the presence of the EBMUD water pipes located above the UST pit. A total of approximately 16.7 tons of impacted soil were removed from the excavation.  Soil samples were collected following excavation including; 4 discrete samples each from the two soil stockpiles, one discrete sample from the center of the excavation floor at approximately 9 feet bgs, and four discrete samples one from each sidewall of the excavation. Soil samples were analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPH-d) TPH as gasoline (TPH-g) TPH as motor oil (TPH-mo), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including methyl-tert-Butyl Ether (MTBE), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, total xylenes (BTEX), fuel oxygenates, lead scavengers, Naphthalene, and Semi-VOCs.  Additional analysis including Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and CAM 17 metals was performed on the tank pit floor sample and one stockpile sample. Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs) was also performed on one of the soil stockpiles.      Laboratory analytical results indicated arsenic was detected up to 9.6 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) and TPH-g, TPH-d, TPH-mo, naphthalene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 2-methylnapthelene, and phenanthrene were detected in soil.  Soil gas samples were not collected.    Additional subsurface investigation activities were conducted in July 2016. Samples were collected in native material to characterize and evaluate the presence of residual petroleum in soil and groundwater at the end of the former UST where access had been limited by buried water lines (EBMUB piping).  Two soil samples were collected from 7.0 feet bgs and 9.5 bgs. Groundwater was encountered at approximately 8.0 feet bgs. Samples were analyzed for TPH-g, TPH-d, TPH-mo, VOCs and SVOCs.  Analytical results indicated TPH-d and MTBE concentrations were detected up to 79 micrograms per liter (ug\/l) and 0.61 ug\/l, respectively, in grab groundwater samples. Tetrachlorethene and chloroform was also detected in groundwater in the vicinity of a subsurface water utility line.    Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has evaluated the data presented in the above-mentioned Report and Work Plan, respectively, in conjunction with the case files, and the State Water Resources Control Board’s (SWRCBs) Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (LTCP).  Based on our review, ACDEH has determined that the Site meets the general criteria and media specific criteria for groundwater (Scenario 5), vapor intrusion, and direct contact under the LTCP.   Public comment for potential case closure is period is open from Tuesday, October 8, 2019 until Monday, December 9, 2019.",

In December 2018 one soil bore was installed through the former UST excavation; however, a soil \/ fill sample in the 0 to 5-foot interval was not collected due to drilling methods, and a determination if the secondary source has been removed to the extent practicable and the environmental quality of the fill could not be undertaken within the Low Threat Closure Policy.  A vapor sample additionally had data quality issues and an additional attempt has been requested for this and the secondary source determination issue.  An additional round of data collection was undertaken with the collection of tank backfill analytical data, and a second subslab vapor sample to overcome the data quality issues.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site consists of an approximately 40,000 square foot triangular-shaped lot which is currently being redeveloped as a multistory office building with sub-grade parking.  The Site is bounded by Hollis Street to the west, a commercial building immediately to the north, and a public greenway to the east.  The southern tip of the Site is at the intersection of Hollis Street and Powell Street.    Two USTs (one 8,000 gallon diesel and one 3,000 gallon gasoline) and the associated dispenser island were installed in the northern portion of the property in 1977, and the USTs and dispenser island were removed in December 1989.  During removal activities, petroleum hydrocarbons were observed in soil and groundwater, pitting and holes were observed in the USTs and a hydrocarbon sheen was observed in the water that had collected in the excavation.  Up to 23 mg\/kg of TPH-d was detected in soil samples from the excavation.  Groundwater samples from the excavation contained maximum concentrations of 90,000 µg\/L TPH-d, 2,300 µg\/L TPH-g, 100 µg\/L benzene, 200 µg\/L toluene, 40 µg\/L ethylbenzene, and 310 µg\/L xylenes.    On 17 June 1993, Summit Engineering supervised installation of groundwater monitoring well MW-1 approximately 10 feet southwest of the former USTs.  During well installation, groundwater was first encountered at approximately 12 feet below ground surface (bgs).  Groundwater was measured at approximately 5 feet bgs 48 hours after well construction and the sample was below the detection limits.  The well was analyzed 3 times through 1994 with similar results.  Subsequent MTBE analysis was below the detection limit of 2 ppb.    From January to March 2008, Treadwell and Rollo performed an investigation which included advancing 18 borings across the entire site (TR-1 through TR-18) to depths between 1.5 feet to 28 feet bgs.  Grab groundwater samples were collected from eleven of the borings.  Maximum petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in soil were 57 mg\/kg TPHd and 309 mg\/kg TPHmo.  Maximum petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in groundwater were 656 µg\/L TPHg and 133 µg\/L TPHd.      Based on the results of the previous investigation, five additional borings (TR-19 through TR-24) were advanced to collect soil and groundwater samples in April 2008.  Soil samples were collected from each of the borings.  A groundwater sample was collected from one boring (TR-19).  Soil and groundwater samples were analyzed for some or all of the following analytes: TPH-g, TPH-d, TPH-mo, PCBs, SVOCs (including PAHs), VOCs, and metals.      In July 2009, Treadwell &amp; Rollo advanced four borings (UST-1 through UST-4) to depths between 20 to 30 ft bgs in the area of the former northern USTs.  Maximum petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in soil were 1.9 mg\/kg TPHg, 530 mg\/kg TPHd and 290 mg\/kg TPHmo.  Maximum petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in groundwater were 960 µg\/L TPHg and 29,000 µg\/L TPHd and 17,000 TPHmo.    In July 2010, Pacific States performed targeted excavation work to remove previously delineated lead impacted soil in shallow soil around the Site for the open DTSC case (Envirstor #0001261) also located at the site, and hydrocarbon impacted soil in the vicinity of the former northern UST.  The UST-related excavation covered an area of approximately 665 ft2 and was extended to a depth of approximately 15 feet deep (approximately 370 yd3).  Excavated soil was off-hauled for disposal at an appropriately permitted facility.      In August 2010, a 1,000-gallon gasoline UST was removed by Golden Gate Tank Removal Company from the southern portion of the property.  The excavation covered an area of approximately 60 ft2 and extended approximately 12 feet deep.  The maximum concentrations detected in confirmation soil samples were 224 mg\/kg TPHmo and 7.4 mg\/kg lead.    In 2011 the entire site was excavated to a depth of 15 feet bgs.  As required in the Soil Management Plan, soil samples were collected from the sidewalls and bottom of the excavation.  The maximum petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in soil in the areas of the USTs were 5.2 mg\/kg TPHg, 210 mg\/kg TPHd, 160 mg\/kg TPHmo  Groundwater samples were obtained from the influent of the dewatering system prior to treatment.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site (APN 49-1178-5) is located at 4575 San Pablo Avenue in Emeryville and operated as a truck repair shop and yard for the Berkeley dairy facility until approximately 1998.  The parcel south of the site (APN 49-1178-4), which has an address of 4501 San Pablo Avenue, was also part of the former Berkeley Farms truck repair shop but was subdivided into a separate fuel leak case (RO0002452) in 2002 since the property was split into separate parcels and the sources of contamination and site history were different for the northern and southern parcels.  Four gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs) were reportedly removed from the site within an area adjacent to San Pablo Avenue in 1966.  No tank closure report or analytical data are available from the 1966 tank removal.  A waste oil tank was reportedly removed from the northwestern portion of the parcel; the date of the removal is not known.   No tank closure report or analytical data are available from the waste oil tank removal.      A soil and groundwater investigation was conducted to investigate the former fuel tanks and waste oil tank in October 1997.  Boring SB6 was located in the former gasoline tank pit along San Pablo Avenue.  TPHd and TPHm were detected in soil at a depth of two feet below ground surface at concentrations of 5 and 8 ppm, respectively.  A grab groundwater sample from boring SB6 contained 120 ppb of TPHd; TPHg and TPHm were not detected.  Based on these results no further investigation or cleanup of the former fuel tank pit was necessary.  Elevated concentrations of TPHg, TPHd, and TPHm were detected in soil samples and the grab groundwater sample from Boring SB7, which was located in the former waste oil tank pit.   Between November 22, 1997 and January 14, 1998, several phases of excavation were conducted to remove contaminated soil and groundwater from the waste oil tank pit   The area surrounding the former waste oil tank pit was excavated to a depth of 13.5 feet bgs.  Final confirmation soil samples collected from the sidewalls and bottom of the former waste oil tank pit did not contain detectable concentrations of TPHg, TPHd, or BTEX.  The maximum concentration of total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons in the final confirmation soil samples was 31 ppm.  A total of approximately 95.5 tons of contaminated soil and 21,600 gallons of water were removed from the former waste oil tank pit during excavation.     Two groundwater monitoring wells (MW-2 and MW-3) were installed at the site and one monitoring well was installed on the adjacent parcel to the south (MW-1) on February 20, 1998.  The three monitoring wells were sampled quarterly from February 1998 to December 2001.  Well MW-2 is several feet west (downgradient) of the former waste oil tank excavation.  TPHd was initially detected (February 1998) in well MW-2 at a concentration of 14,000 ppb.  The concentration of TPHd in groundwater from well MW-2 decreased to &lt;50 ppb during the five most recent monitoring events between December 2000 and December 2001.  TPHg and benzene were detected in groundwater from well MW-2 at concentrations up to 2,000 ppb and 220 ppb but were not detected during the five most recent monitoring events between December 2000 and December 2001.  TPHg, TPHd, and BTEX were not detected in well MW-3, which is cross gradient from the potential on-site sources.      Three additional soil borings designated B-1 through B-3 were installed downgradient of the former waste oil tank pit on the AC Transit property west of the site.  TPHg, TPHd, TPHm, BTEX, and MTBE were not detected in soil and groundwater samples from the three borings.",

Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) is the regulatory oversight agency of the  subject environmental clean]up case (the gCaseh) at the above listed property (the gSiteh). The Case was opened by ACDEH in 2017 to further investigate non-petroleum, non-underground storage tank related subsurface contamination at the Site discovered during Site investigations conducted under a former Leaking Underground Storage Tank Cleanup Case also associated with the Site (Case No. RO0000071 and GeoTracker Global ID T0600202203) that was closed by ACDEH in April 2018.     The case file present: (1) a summary of the Site history and subsurface contamination beneath the Site from historical landfilling and industrial\/commercial uses at and in the vicinity of the Site; (2) documentation of the destruction of groundwater monitoring wells and soil vapor probes; (3) documentation of the installation of environmental engineering controls installed at the Site to protect construction workers and Site occupants from exposure to the subsurface contamination; and (4) institutional and administrative controls to provide notice of the subsurface contamination and obligations related to the contamination and to facilitate compliance with requirements for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the environmental engineering controls installed at the Site to protect human health and the environment by reducing the risk of exposure to residual hazardous materials.     Based on ACDEHfs review of the above listed documents and information in the Case files, ACDEH has determined the following:  1. No further remedial action is required at the Site under the current land use and Site development configuration of the parcel with a commercial building; and    2. Long-term management of the environmental engineering controls installed at the Site and implementation of institutional and administrative controls for the property will minimize risk to Site receptors from exposure to residual subsurface contamination at the Site by limiting potential exposure of Site occupants and construction\/maintenance workers to residual subsurface contamination in soil, soil vapor and groundwater to levels that are protective of human health.    Therefore, ACDEH has changed the status of the Cleanup Program Site Case No. RO0003267 from gSite Assessmenth to gLong-Term Managementh.",

The facility operated from 1924 until 1992.  Facility operations resulted in releases of chemicals of concern to the subsurface including but not limited to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which constitute hazardous materials as defined in Health &amp; Safety Code Section 25260 of the California Code of Regulations.     Multiple agencies (United States Environmental Protection Agency - Region IX [USEPA], the Department of Toxic Substances Control [DTSC], San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board [Regional Water Board], Alameda County Department of Environmental Health [ACDEH]) are providing regulatory oversight of the investigation and cleanup of chemicals of concern. Environmental cases associated with the former WEC facility include Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0002742 and Geotracker Global ID No. T06019701198, Westinghouse Electric - Parcel 1, 5815 - 5899 Peladeau, Emeryville, ACDEH\/USEPA lead; Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0002743 and Geotracker Global ID No. SL20235853, Westinghouse Electric - Parcel 4, 5890 Horton Street, Emeryville, ACDEH\/USEPA lead; Emeryville Mound Parcel, 59th Street &amp; Horton Street, Emeryville, Envirostor No. 01360057, DTSC\/USEPA lead); and Westinghouse (Former), 6100 Horton Street, Emeryville, Getracker Global ID No. SLT2O06571, Regional Water Board lead). Corrective actions and engineering controls implemented at the former WEC facility include demolition of the facility, removal of underground storage tanks, construction of a slurry wall, excavation of PCB impacted soil and offsite disposal or consolidation beneath various soil and hardscape caps on the parcels, installation of vapor mitigation systems.    ACDEH and USEPA are currently working with the Responsible Party to evaluate the risk to the public and the environment from PCBs in soil at the site and develop appropriate engineering controls and implement institutional controls to reduce exposure risk.

Additional documents can be viewed over the Internet on the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health website (http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm). Both databases should be reviewed to obtain a complete history.    Three 550-gallon USTs (two gasoline, one compartmented diesel and motor oil) located in a common pit were removed in October 1995.  During removal the gas USTs were observed to be intact while the motor oil \/ diesel UST was observed to have several holes.  The three USTs were in a common pit and excavation confirmation samples delineated the vertical extent directly beneath the USTs; however, not the lateral or vertical extent outside the UST excavation.    Investigation activities were conducted between 1995 and 2016 to evaluate the extent of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination impacts to soil, soil vapor and groundwater from the three USTs and evaluate risk to human health and the environment. The investigations included (1) collection of soil samples from the tank pit subsequent to overexcavation in 1995 and two soils borings (HA1, HA3) advanced in the vicinity of the former tank pit in 2015; (2) collection of groundwater samples from four onsite monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-4) periodically between 1995 and 2015 and one grab groundwater sample from boring HA1 in 2015; and (3) collection of soil vapor samples from six temporary onsite vapor probes.    Remediation was conducted by over excavating hydrocarbon contaminated soil directly below the former USTs in October 1995 to a depth of 12 feet below grade surface. Other than removal of the USTs, no remediation was conducted.    This UST release case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH has determined that the site meets all the LTCP General Criteria and the Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater.    The site does not meet the LTCP Media Specific Criteria for Vapor Intrusion and Outdoor Air due to shallow groundwater that limits a bioattenuation zone to less than 5 feet. However, based on low levels of petroleum volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soil, soil vapor and groundwater and the land use in the vicinity of the former tank pit, ACDEH has determined that there is a low vapor intrusion risk to occupants of onsite and adjacent offsite buildings.    This site also does not meet the Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Media-Specific Criteria due to the lack of analysis in soil for naphthalene. However, based on calculations of estimated naphthalene concentrations present in soil samples at the site using criteria presented in the State Water Resources Control Board’s LUFT Manual for naphthalene percentages present in fresh diesel and fuel products, ACDEH has determined that there is a low direct contact and outdoor air exposure risk.    Refer to Attachments 4 through 7 in the closure summary for detailed information on the LTCP evaluation.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "During the installation of new dispensers in September 1992, a leak from damaged fiberglass piping connected to an underground storage tank at the site was reported. The release was reported as approximately 3,200 gallons of super unleaded gasoline. In response to the release, five tank backfill wells (S-1 through S-4, and S-11) and six groundwater monitoring wells (S-5 through S-10) were installed at the site sometime prior to August 1983. Boring logs and well construction details are unavailable for these wells. An Unauthorized Release Report (URR) was submitted by Shell on September 10, 1982.  Free product removal was reportedly conducted in 1989 but no documentation of the removal is available.    Site investigation activities were conducted in 1996 and 2006.  A fuel system upgrade was conducted in 2004. Annual groundwater monitoring is currently ongoing to confirm that the concentrations of dissolved phase petroleum hydrocarbons are decreasing from elevated levels.  The site was affected by a  release of diesel from product piping on September 30, 2013.  During May and June 2014, three gasoline USTs and one diesel UST were removed.  Some impacted soil was removed during the tank removal.  Historical industrial debris consisting of bricks, glass, asphalt shingles, insulation, and wood debris were encountered in the tank excavation.  A soil, removal action took place in June 2014 in the area of the 2013 diesel fuel release.  The base of the diesel excavation consisted primarily of roof shingles and tar paper debris.  Downgradient delineation of plume extent between the 2013 diesel fuel release and San Francisco Bay is required.",

Possible product piping extended beneath adjacent Building M.  Because removal was not possible the piping was capped.  Concentrations up to 5,800 mg\/kg TEPH, 0.067 mg\/kg total PCBs, and 34 mg\/kg arsenic were detected in soil, and 130 mg\/l (130,000 ug\/l) TEPH and 0.75 ug\/l PCB were detected in a water sample.  The site was transferred to RWQCB (06\/22\/2011) for incorporation in to the existing Chiron Risk Management Plan to manage residual soil and groundwater contamination.

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at https:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Site History and Description of Corrective Actions:  The former Peralta Street Right Of Way (ROW) is a one-block-long northeast trending alley bounded by Emery Street to the southwest and by San Pablo Avenue to the northeast.  The approximately 570-foot long private drive is approximately ¼-acre in area and is situated at the southeastern corner of the 51-acre retail and residential redevelopment project named the East Baybridge Center (EBC).    Due to the size and history of the EBC property, Catellus Land Development Corporation (Catellus), the EBC developer, used three areas transected by Yerba Buena Avenue and Hollis Street to aid with the geographic distinction during the environmental characterization of the EBC development.  The portion of the EBC property east of Hollis Street and south of Yerba Buena Avenue was designated Area A; the area east of Hollis Street and north of Yerba Buena Avenue was designated Area B; and the area west of Hollis Street was designated Area C.  These area designations were used throughout EBC site redevelopment.  Area A of the EBC project consisted of Santa Fe Terminal Services (SFTS)-Area A, Clipper Exxpress warehouse, LDS warehouse, and the segment of Peralta Street between San Pablo Avenue and Emery Street.  The ownership of the Peralta Street ROW was transferred to Catellus by the City of Emeryville on April 14, 1992.  Area B of the EBC project consisted of SFTS-Area B, and the Ransome Construction Company.  Area C of the EBC project consisted of SFTS-Area C, Bashland, Bay Area Warehouse, and M and N Trucking Warehouse.  The SFTS areas were operated by the railroad company and consisted of railroad tracks and sidings and open areas for the storage of rolling stock.  Except for Peralta Street and Ransome, the facilities in areas A, B and C consisted of warehouse structures serviced by rail sidings alongside the buildings.  Ransome was also serviced by a rail siding but lacked a large warehouse structure.  Unimproved access roads typically paralleled the rail road tracks.      ACEH case files for the sites within the EBC development consist of RO0000049 (Ransome), RO0000326 (Bashland), RO0000369 (Bay Area Warehouse and SFTS-Area C), RO0003092 (M and N Trucking Warehouse), RO0003093 (Clipper Exxpress, LDS, and SFTS Areas A and B), and RO0003111 (Peralta Street ROW).      The Peralta Street ROW is currently owned by East Bay Bridge Retail LLC and occupies a portion of the EBC development having Assessor’s Parcel Number APN 49-619-6 in the City of Emeryville, California.  Current development consists of paved private alley. The Peralta Street ROW was owned by the City of Emeryville and transferred to the Catellus Development Corporation (Catellus) in 1990.  Catellus developed the Peralta Street ROW as part of the 51-acre EBC redevelopment project.  Catellus merged with Prologis in 2005.  The project at the time of the Prologis merger was identified as the “East Bay Bridge Shopping Center”.  Catellus was subsequently renamed PAC Operating Limited Partnership, as subsidiary of Prologis.  The ownership of the property was transferred to East Bay Bridge Retail LLC in 2011.  Historical documentation indicates Peralta Street was in existence since before 1931.  The land to the west of Peralta street was occupied in 1931 and 1940 by a vehicle storage and wrecking yard.    A heating oil underground storage tank (UST) on the Peralta Street ROW was encountered in June, 1993 during preparation for site redevelopment.  The tank was situated beneath the sidewalk within the EBC project area.  On June 7, 1993, a sample of the tank contents was profiled and the tank contents were consistent with diesel fuel or fuel oil.  The tank, a 1,500-gallon heating oil USTwhich serviced the commercial\/residential 3-story building at 3819 San Pablo Avenue, was removed on September 22, 1993.  Five tank pit confirmation soil samples were analyzed and 120 mg\/kg total oil and grease (TOG) was detected.  The profile sample of the 20 cubic-yards of excavated soil analyzed and 17 mg\/kg TPHd and 93 mg\/kg TOG was detected.  Groundwater was not encountered in the excavation pit.  No additional remedial work was performed along the Peralta Street ROW.    No monitoring wells were installed at the Peralta Street ROW and no groundwater samples were collected.  Data from two off-site groundwater monitoring wells, designated LF-1 and LF-2, installed in January 1991 in the vicinity of and down gradient of Peralta Street.  Groundwater concentrations of TPHg, TPHd, TPHo, and BTEX were reported below the laboratory reporting limits.  Groundwater monitoring wells LF-1 and LF-2 were decommissioned in July 1993 in preparation of redevelopment activities east of Hollis Street.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The subject parcel is a part of the Shellmound Properties development in Emeryville.  A portion of the subject parcel is in the “Northern Area” of remedial actions, while the majority of the parcel is in the “Southern Area” of remedial actions.  Remedial actions were overseen by the DTSC between 1996 and 2000.  DTSC is currently actively providing CAP maintenance oversight related to that work.  This LOP case involves the UST portion of the Pfizer parcel.  Review of Envirostor indicates DTSC and RP were aware of USTs at site in Feasibility Study, with statements that USTs would be found and contaminated soil excavated at that time.  Primary issue under DTSC jurisdiction was arsenic, pesticides, and other contaminates.   Remedial Completion Report contains no reference to work at the known UST locations (esp. see figures 9 &amp; 11), although report references a small UST found on the eastern edge of the parcel.    The June 2000 \"Environmental Risk Management Plan\" (Erler &amp; Kalinowski) on Envirostor (Site No. 01890019) indicates the area of the LOP UST case was excavated (described as \"Areas of Completed Environmental Excavations\" on Figures 4 &amp; 8 of this report; portions of these figures are also in ACEH electronic file as CORRES_2011-05-03 and CORRES_2011-05--12).  Additional excavations do not appear to have occurred beyond those shown in this report.  Benzene is reported by DTSC to have been included in some of the risk calculations for the referenced report.  According to the \"First Semi-Annual 2009 Groundwater Monitoring Report\" (May 29, 2009, Erler &amp; Kalinowski; available on Envirostor) BTEX, MTBE, DIPE, &amp; TBA have been non-detectable in well EBS4 since May 2003.  This well is in close proximity to the former UST locations.  Well EBS5 and storm drain sampling point SD-3 are also in close proximity; however, are a bit further north from the former location of the USTs.  TPH is not monitored by DTSC.  DTSC reports the matter is considered closed as of 8\/22\/2000 gwl 3\/25\/2016",

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The subject site is one of seven sites with a co-mingled soil and groundwater contaminant plumes sites (Oakland National Engravers; RO0000079; Dunne Quality Paints; RO0000073; San Francisco French Bread Company; RO0000171; Celis Service Station; RO0000453; SNK Andante; RO0002530; Oak Walk; RO0002733, and Magnolia Terrace; RO0003004).  The groundwater contaminant plume extends a minimum distance of approximately 1,200 feet in length (see attached paleochannel figure).  The soil and groundwater plumes appear to have moved through a series of granular paleochannels (with significant interconnectivity) that is present beneath the sites.    Sites immediately adjacent to the subject site appear to be the source of significant residual gasoline contamination at the subject site (San Francisco French Bread Company; RO0000171 and Celis Service Station; RO0000453).  A Corrective Action Plan (CAP) has previously been generated and fully implemented for the subject site after a required 30-day public participation period was conducted.  Unfortunately the remedial efforts were not successful in meeting the stated CAP objectives and ACEH requested further a further remedial effort in November 2011.  Groundwater concentrations in September 2010 were up to 1,800 µg\/l TPHd, 3,400 µg\/l TPHms, 49,000 µg\/l TPHg, and 14,000 µg\/l benzene (and included other standard fuel related compounds).  In March 2012, concentrations up to 2,200 µg\/l TPHd, 3,500 µg\/l TPHms, 26,000 µg\/l TPHg, and 9,500 µg\/l benzene were present.  Rather than the submittal of an updated CAP, a risk assessment was submitted in response to the request for further remedial efforts.    The presence of MTBE beneath Oak Walk may tie this contamination to the Celis Service Station as MTBE is generally not seen at the San Francisco Bread Company site.  You should be aware that the extent of contaminant migration from the Celis Service Station site on to the adjacent SNK Andante site (RO0002530) appears to have been partly controlled by very old abandoned foundational elements that apparently allowed free-phase and groundwater with elevated concentrations to migrate into and beneath that site significantly further than anticipated during redevelopment planning.  While speculative for this site, this may have been an element of contaminant migration into the Oak Walk site from the Celis site.",

During investigation activities conducted in January 2018, soil vapor samples were collected along the property boundary in the vicinity of the former trichloroethylene (TCE) degreaser on the subject site. Soil vapor sample analytical results reported a maximum TCE concentration of 390 micrograms per cubic meter (µg\/m3) in soil vapor probe SG-4 located at the property boundary, which is significantly above current human health risk based screening levels for TCE.    This data coupled with data in the case file for the subject site indicates that residual contamination poses may pose an unacceptable risk to public health, safety, or environment.  Therefore, in accordance recommendations in the Regional Water Quality Control Board’s (RWQCB) “Interim Framework for Assessment of Vapor Intrusion at TCE-Contaminated Sites in the San Francisco Bay Region,” ACDEH has re-opened this case to further evaluate the potential TCE volatilization to indoor air exposure pathway.",

Additional documents can be viewed over the Internet on the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health website (http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm). Both databases should be reviewed to obtain a complete history.    Fuel Leak Case No. RO0003069 was opened in 2011 by ACDEH when a 1,000-gallon heating oil underground storage tank (UST) was discovered in the sidewalk adjacent to the building located at 1550 Park Avenue in Emeryville, California during a City of Emeryville street improvement project along Park Avenue. The case was opened to evaluate potential impacts to human health and the environment from an unauthorized release from the heating oil UST. Other potential chemicals of concern at the site associated with historic land uses including a release from a 1,500-gallon gasoline UST that was removed from the site in 1994 were not evaluated as part of this case.    Site investigation activities were conducted to evaluate the extent of subsurface impacts to soil and groundwater from the unauthorized release from the UST system.  After removal of the UST, 20 tons of contaminated soil was off-hauled to an appropriate receiving landfill.  The subject investigation consisted of the installation of 12 soil bores (S1 to S11, and S13) and one groundwater monitoring well (S12 \/ MW-1) to delineate the lateral offsite extent of soil and groundwater contamination.    This UST release case has been evaluated by ACDEH for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH has determined that the site meets all the LTCP General Criteria and the Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater. The site does not meet the LTCP Media Specific Criteria for Vapor Intrusion and Outdoor Air for several reasons, including the lack of a bioattenuation zone due to shallow groundwater coupled with total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations greater than 100 milligrams per kilogram within the 0 to 5 foot depth interval. However, petroleum volatile organic compounds, including naphthalene, in groundwater samples in the vicinity of the former UST were non-detect or detected trace concentrations and indicate that residual contamination at the site does not pose a vapor intrusion risk at the site or downgradient of the site. Additionally, the site does not meet the LTCP Media Specific Criteria for Direct Contact for unconditional use. However. The former UST was identified as a heating oil, or possibly a Bunker C heating oil UST. Poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are not required to be evaluated under the LTCP for a heating oil UST; however, are for Bunker C oil.  Therefore an evaluation of PAHs was conducted due to the unknown use history of the former UST.  The highest of benzo(a)pyrene toxicity equivalent (BaPe) at the site (sample S1-3.5) is 0.26 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) ), which meets the commercial PAH criteria, but not the residential criteria. However, under the current land use scenario the exposure pathways is incomplete as the site is covered with buildings and hardscape.      Other than removal of soil around the former UST, no remediation was conducted. Due to residual contamination at the site, the site has been closed with site management requirements. Refer to the Case Closure Summary in the case files for detailed information on site management requirements.    ACDEH recommends that during the environmental due diligence process (initiated as part of activities including, but not limited to, property transactions, bank refinancing, and redevelopment) that the site and parcels in the vicinity of the site be evaluated for risk from and exposure to potential chemicals of concern identified at this site.",

Five soil bores (BH-A to BH-E) were installed in October 1998; grab groundwater was also collected.  Concentrations of concern were encountered.  Wells MW-1 to MW-3 were installed in January 1999.  Two soil bores were installed in October 1999 (BH-F and BH-G).  Wells MW-1 to MW-3 were decommissioned in late April and early May 2000.  Seven soil bores (SB-1 to SB-7) and 12 vapor points were installed in December 2004.

One diesel and unleaded gas USTs were removed on October 12, 1995 from the site.  Previously, in March 1995 five soil bores were installed and collected soil and groundwater samples.  In July 1995 seven soil bores were installed and soil and grab groundwater were collected.  Excavation of 35 yards from the gasoline tank and 19 yards from the diesel tank occurred; however, all used to backfill gasoline tank pit; clean fill used to backfill diesel tank.  Four additional bores installed March 1997, as well as MW-1.  MW-1 monitored quarterly between September 1996 and June 1998.  Semi-annual monitoring proposed thereafter for one to two additional years; MTBE concentrations rose significantly during that period.    In January 2016 soil bores SB-17 to SB-19 were installed to resume investigation of the site.  Based on the information further assessment was appropriate and in in October 2017 wells EW-1 to EW-4 were installed, along with two soil vapor wells SV-1 and SV-2.  Soil vapor could not be collected at the time due to the presence of groundwater in the vapor wells.  Groundwater monitoring was conducted for four quarters.  A follow up soil vapor investigation was proposed in August 2018, conditionally approved, and implemented.  Sub-slab vapor points SS-1 and SS-2 were installed adjacent to the building and indicate low vapor concentrations; however, the data is in conflict with groundwater data (especially SS-2 and EW-2).  Consequently a meeting was held in September 2019 to identify a pathway to closure, and a work plan was verbally agreed upon, and subsequently conditionally approved in a directive letter.  This included the installation of two groundwater monitoring wells due to a potential change in the understanding of the groundwater gradient, and four shallow soil vapor wells (to 2.5 to 3 feet due to very shallow groundwater) to investigate the vapor data conflict.",

Four Geoprobe bores were installed in October 1997 to investigate the UST related contamination; however, limited data relative to gasoline-related hydrocarbons have been submitted. Available records indicate the two USTs were abandoned in-place to limit interference to the then on-going remedial activities related to the metal plating operations at the 1401 and 1421 Park Avenue properties.     The case is currently proposed for closure. The non-petroleum contaminants associated with the SCP case is still ongoing.",

The subject parcel was redeveloped as a service station and currently has three USTs.  The northern portion of the larger parcel has been redeveloped and is being handled as a separate case.  Three dewatering wells for the adjacent redevelopment, immediately adjacent to the subject parcel, contained consistent elevated hydrocarbon concentrations that required treatment prior to discharge.  These concentrations may be related to previous site use or to current service station operations and are currently unresolved.  Underground parking at the adjacent redevelopment may require ongoing dewatering and thus likely treatment before discharge.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Shell Development Company (Shell) initially purchased 4 acres of land on the Site in 1927. In 1928, Shell established the Facility on the Site and conducted energy and petrochemical related research until 1972. In 1935, additional land was acquired to allow the expansion of pilot-plant installations. Operation areas included office buildings, pilot plant structures, aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) and underground storage tanks (USTs), reaction testing equipment, drum storage areas, railcar loading racks, and related infrastructure.     From 1928 to the end of World War II, the Facility primarily conducted research and development in small-scale pilot plants. At the time of establishment, the Facility had three institutions: one Experimental Plants Department and two Process Development Laboratories. In 1933, a department was set up for research in oil-refining technology. In 1934, a department was set up for fundamental physical research. In 1935, two departments were created for research in oil production and for research on applications of chemical products. Prior to World War II, research and pilot testing was concentrated on propylene, butylenes, lubricants, resins, esters, alcohols, ketone derivatives, and glycerin. Both synthetic rubber (from butadiene) and synthetic glycerin were developed by Shell at this Facility. During the War, all work on proprietary Shell products was suspended; and the effort was directed to military projects, including toluene extractions, aviation gasoline additives, catalysts, cumene substitute, di-tert-butyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, a new penicillin recovery process, rust inhibitors, and new uses for asphalt. After the War, the Facility had two main functions: pilot plants and product development. In the late 1940's through 1972, research and development was conducted on plasticizers, detergents, ethylene derivatives, catalysts, polyvinylchloride (PVC), polymers, ethylenes, gasoline additives, various oils and fuels, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and isopropyl alcohol. During the period of approximately 1945 through 1949, the Facility conducted laboratory experiments with potential agricultural compounds to support Shell's Modesto laboratory. No pilot tests were performed using the agricultural compounds. During the Facility's operation, the wastewater generated from all laboratories and plants was collected, skimmed of oil, and discharged to the sanitary sewer. Gaseous wastes were burned in a flare or in a waste incinerator. Liquid wastes were sent off site in drums.     In 1973, Shell sold the property. In 1984, Cetus sold the main portion of the Site to BGR, who subsequently leased the buildings to Cetus and Chiron. The City of Emeryville Redevelopment Agency purchased the property in the southern comer, and sold it to BGR in 1987. BGR developed the property and leased it to Chiron, who used the V Building for research and administrative functions. However, it was suggested by another reference that the City of Emeryville purchased the property in the southern comer in 1979 and sold it to the Wareham Property Group in 1987.     Current uses of the Site include Chiron offices, laboratories, facilities, and parking. The former V Building is currently used as live-work space for an artist's co-operative.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    In April 1987 at least one soil bore was installed to investigate the status of an UST at the site; hydrocarbons were encountered in soil.  In July 1987 a 2,000-gallon UST was removed from the site, and well MW-1 was installed.  In 1988, well MW-1 was abandoned by unknown means and 60 cubic yards of soil was excavated from the former UST location.  In September to November 1989 wells MW-2 to MW-5 were installed.  Wells EW-1, MW-6, and MW-7 were installed in March 1990.  A pump and treat system with GAC was installed in December 1990 and operated until October 1993.  In August 1994 nutrient introduction was begun as the start of an in-situ bioremediation pilot test.  In September 1994 well MW-8 was installed.  In December 1994 an in-situ bioremediation pilot program was initiated using hydrogen peroxide (into wells EW-1, MW-2, and MW-8).  In-situ bioremediation continued until December 1998.  Groundwater monitoring ceased in October 2000 and resumed in October 2010.  A preferential pathway study was also conducted in 2010.  Additional subsurface investigations were conducted in 2012, and included a temporary well between wells MW-4 and MW-6, the installation of five soil bores, and two sub-slab vapor probes in the southeast portion of the building.  The presence of a methane ventilation system for the building and the existence of  an intrusive earthworks health and safety protocol program was also disclosed.      Site Management Requirements:   This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP).  To manage residual petroleum vapor intrusion to indoor air and direct contact and outdoor air exposure at the site the following documents are considered a part of this closure, and detail mitigation measures required at the site:    Engineering Controls (ECs):  Operation and Maintenance Manual, Methane Collection, Control and Monitoring System, The Atrium Property, prepared by PES Environmental, Inc., and dated April 14, 2005.  The document is available on the ACEH Local Oversight Program (LOP) website and on GeoTracker under the file name: RDIP_R_2005-04-14    Institutional Controls (ICs):  Intrusive Earthwork Guidance Plan, The Atrium at Emery Bay Plaza, prepared by PES Environmental, Inc., and dated May 5, 2005.  The document is available on the ACEH LOP website and on GeoTracker under the file name: MISC_R_2005-05-05.    If a change in land use to any residential or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, including modification of the existing building footprint for the commercial building, or a building remodel that modifies the existing methane collection system, ACEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  Due to the potential for vapor intrusion to indoor air for future buildings and direct contact exposure, ACEH will re-evaluate the case upon receipt of approved development\/construction plans.    Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.  These are detailed in the Intrusive Earthwork Guidance Plan, The Atrium at Emery Bay Plaza.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is located at 4501 San Pablo Avenue in Emeryville and is currently the site of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant.  The site operated as a truck repair shop and yard for the Berkeley dairy facility until approximately 1998.  The property directly north of this site, which has an address of 4575 San Pablo Avenue, was also part of the former Berkeley Farms truck repair shop, but the property was subdivided into a separate fuel leak case (RO245) in 2002 since the sources of contamination, site history, and ownership were different for the northern and southern portions of the property.  A service station is reported to have operated at the site from approximately 1966 through 1979 after which the site was used as an auto repair facility until 1985.  An AC Transit maintenance yard is west (downgradient) of the site (fuel leak case RO    The former service station was demolished in approximately 1985 and three former fuel underground storage tanks (USTs) were reportedly removed from the site.  No tank closure report or analytical data are available from the tank removal.  Three soil borings were advanced at the site in during an October 1997 soil and groundwater investigation to investigate the former fuel tanks and dispensers.  Boring SB2 was located in the former fuel tank pit and boring SB3 was located adjacent to the former dispensers.  A third boring, boring SB1, was located near the eastern edge of the former tank pit.  Total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) were detected in soil from each of the borings at maximum concentrations of 140 ppm (SB1), 25 ppm (SB2), and 210 ppm (SB3).  TPHg were detected in grab groundwater samples from the three borings at concentrations of 5,300 ppb (SB1), 48,000 ppb (SB2), and 9,900 ppb (SB3).      On February 20, 1998 one monitoring well was installed at the site.  An additional two monitoring wells were installed on the property to the north (fuel leak case RO245).  Quarterly monitoring was conducted at the sites from February 1998 to September 2002.    Due to the elevated concentrations of fuel hydrocarbons detected in the borings and monitoring wells, the former fuel tank pit was re-excavated between April 30, 1998 and June 1, 1998.  Based on the observations of piping and debris in the tank pit, it appeared that some or all of the tankpit backfill material had been replaced in the tank pit following tank removal.  Three phases of overexcavation and confirmation sampling were conducted to remove petroleum-hydrocarbon impacted soil.  A total of approximately 400 cubic yards of soil and 15,000 gallons of water were removed. Confirmation samples collected from the sidewalls and bottom of the excavation contained relatively low concentrations of TPH as diesel (60 ppm) and no detectable concentrations of TPH as gasoline and BTEX.      In order to delineate the downgradient plume, soil and groundwater samples were collected from three soil borings (B-4 through B-6) that were advanced downgradient of the former tank pit on the AC Transit site to the west.  One soil sample and one grab groundwater sample was collected from each boring.  TPH as gasoline, TPH as motor oil, BTEX, and MTBE were not detected in the soil and groundwater samples from all borings.  TPH as diesel was detected in groundwater from boring B-5 at a concentration of 66 ppb but was not detected in soil or groundwater from the other borings.  These data indicated the extent of the hydrocarbon plume from the site was generally limited to the site.    During construction of the foundation for the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in December 1998, additional hydrocarbon-impacted soils were encountered in the area of a pump island and product piping.  An area beneath the building footprint approximately 45 feet wide by 90 feet long was excavated to a depth of approximately 3.75 feet.  A total of 703 tons of soil was excavated and disposed offsite at the Allied Waste Landfill in Manteca.      Based on the results of a risk assessment (Waterstone Environmental 1999), a vapor barrier consisting of a 20 mil thick layer of Paraseal GM liner material was laid down at approximately 42 inches below grade over the excavated area.  This area included the building footprint and additional areas north of the building.  The vapor barrier overlaps were sealed and layers of 10 mil visqueen were laid over the Paraseal.  Vapor collection piping was reportedly installed along the inside of the foundation walls and then routed inside the wall and outside to the rooftop.      Well MW1, which was damaged during construction, was decommissioned and replacement well MW-1A was installed on July 30, 1999.  On September 7, 2002, five soil vapor samples were collected above the vapor barrier (approximately two feet below grade) at various points on the perimeter of the restaurant building.  TPHg and BTEX were not detected in the five vapor samples.  Well MW1 and replacement well MW1A were sampled quarterly from February 1998 to December 2001 in conjunction with sampling the two monitoring wells on the parcel to the north.  Fuel hydrocarbon concentrations in groundwater have generally attenuated following the overexcavation of the tank pit and soil removal in the area of the fast food restaurant.  During the last groundwater monitoring event conducted at the site, TPHg was detected at 61 ppb, TPHd was detected at 85 ppb, and benzene was detected at 0.72 ppb.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    A 2002 Phase I Environmental Assessment found that the site had been a gasoline service station between approximately 1947 and 1969.  A 2004 subsurface investigation conducted a geophysical survey and found a generalized disturbed signature beneath the site.  Five soil bores were also installed and found \"low to moderate\" concentrations of TPH, BTEX, and MTBE, generally below regulatory thresholds.  Two petroleum hydrocarbon hotspots were encountered during site grading, up to 20 eight-foot deep soil bores were installed around Hotspot #1, soil samples collected, and ultimately approximately 25.5 tons of impacted soil was excavated off hauled.  Hotspot #2 is described as a fill pit presumed to be a location of a former UST, soil samples were collected, and ultimately approximately 127.1 tons of soil was excavated and off-hauled.  Concentrations up to 310 mg\/kg TPHg, 629 mg\/kg TPHd, 1,700 mg\/kg TPHmo, &lt;2.5 mg\/kg benzene, &lt;2.5 mg\/kg toluene, 3.7 mg\/kg ethylbenzene, 5.3 mg\/kg total xylenes, and &lt;2.5 mg\/kg MTBE were encountered in the two hotspot locations.  The chromatographic pattern for the TPHg and TPHd analysis are reported not to match standard patterns.    One UST of unknown size was encountered and abandoned in-place during installation of the fire service as the site continued construction.  The UST was cleaned and backfilled.  One soil sample was collected at a depth of approximately 5.5 ft bgs at a location approximately 2 feet east of the UST.  Analysis of the soil sample indicated that 980 mg\/kg TPHg, 870 mg\/kg TPHd, 3,300 mg\/kg TPHmo, &lt;0.77 mg\/kg benzene, 2.3 mg\/kg toluene, 1.5 mg\/kg ethylbenzene, 11.4 mg\/kg total xylenes, and &lt;0.77 mg\/kg MTBE were present; additional analytes were also detected.    Seven soil bores were advanced around the perimeter of the site in January 2014 and soil and grab groundwater samples were collected in order to characterize the site under the LTCP.  A Request for Closure was submitted in June 2014.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    An underground storage tank was discovered in the public right of way adjacent to 5679 Horton Street in Emeryville, CA.  The UST was removed on June 17, 2015,  Soil samples collected from the tank excavation contained total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel at concentrations up to 4,400 milligrams per kilogram.  A grab groundwater sample collected near the tank excavation contained TPHd at a concentration of 403 micrograms per liter.  Several volatile organic compounds were also detected in the grab groundwater sample.    Current Land-use at time of Closure  The subject site is located in the public right-of-way beneath Horton Street in Emeryville, California, and has therefore been classified as commercial property.  Due to residual contamination, the site was closed with site management requirements that include notifying Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) of a proposed change in land use to any residential or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment or building alteration is proposed that affect or disturb the existing subsurface conditions at the site.    Adjacent Property(ies) Land-use at Time of Closure  To the east and west lie commercial properties, while Horton Street runs (lies) to the north and south.  Groundwater contamination from the former underground storage tank (UST) appears to extend to the west beneath the FMW Site.  Should off-site redevelopment occur, ACDEH recommends evaluating the redevelopment site(s) for chemicals of concern identified on this site.    Historic Land-use \/ Site Investigation  The property at 5679 Horton Street is currently owned by the City of Emeryville, and was occupied by the City’s Public Works Department for use as a corporation yard between 1999 and 2012.  At one time the property was also a part of the former Marchant Calculating machine Company facility, and is also known as the FMW Site.    Nine soil bores were installed at the site to collect soil, grab groundwater, and soil vapor samples.  No wells were installed, and existing data from the adjacent and downgradient FMW Site was utilized to determine the extent of contamination at the site and vicinity.    Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern  Chemicals of Potential concern at the site include TPH as diesel and naphthalene.  Potential exposure routes are direct contact with contaminated soil.  Remediation Activities    Other than removal of the UST and associated soil, no remediation was conducted at the site.    Case Closure &amp; Future Site Management Requirements   This UST release case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.    The site does not meet any of the Vapor Intrusion Media-Specific Criteria of the Low Threat Closure Policy; however, site data has been evaluated and the site has been closed under the current site conditions as a public street with a low risk for vapor intrusion.    The UST associated with this case is reported to have stored heating oil.  Thus under the LTCP, analysis for poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are not required within the Direct Contact Media-Specific Criteria.  However, due to the potential for unknown blends of fuels to have been stored in the UST, PAHs have been evaluated.  Given this consideration, the site would not meet the residential or commercial LTCP criterion due to the lack of analysis in soil for PAHs in the 0 to 5 foot interval.  However, based on available analytical data in the 0 - 5 foot depth interval the maximum concentration of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel or motor oil is 427 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg).  Thus ACDEH concludes that the potential for residual PAH soil contamination to be present beneath the site between 0 and 5 feet in depth, at concentrations over the LTCP Media-Specific numeric values, is unlikely.    Additionally, under the current land use, the site is entirely paved resulting in a low potential for direct contact exposure under the current land use as a city street.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of potential residual contamination will be managed with a land use restriction, and require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party and current property owner, prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    Refer to Attachments 1 through 5 in the Closure Summary Form for analysis details.",

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The subject site is one of seven sites with a co-mingled soil and groundwater contaminant plumes sites (Oakland National Engravers; RO0000079; Dunne Quality Paints; RO0000073; San Francisco French Bread Company; RO0000171; Celis Service Station; RO0000453; SNK Andante; RO0002530; Oak Walk; RO0002733, and Magnolia Terrace; RO0003004).  The groundwater contaminant plume extends a minimum distance of approximately 1,200 feet in length (see paleochannel figure).  The soil and groundwater plumes appear to have moved through a series of granular paleochannels (with significant interconnectivity) that is present beneath the sites.    At least three USTs were discovered during site redevelopment at this site; however, existing data indicates the extent of contamination from these USTs was limited.  While these USTs were found during redevelopment, the site appears to have been primarily impacted by contamination sourced largely from the San Francisco French Bread Company site (RO0000171), by the Celis Service Station (RO0000453), and two former paint manufacturing sites (Oakland National Engravers; RO0000079 and Dunne Quality Paints; RO0000073).  The extent of contaminant migration from the Celis Service Station site on to the subject site appears to have been partly controlled by very old abandoned foundational elements that apparently allowed free-phase and groundwater with elevated concentrations to migrate into and beneath the subject site significantly further than anticipated during redevelopment planning.  At present, despite multiple requests, an agency deed restriction has not been recorded.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "A subsurface investigation was requested for the subject site.  Wells MW-1 to MW-9 and soil bores B-1 to B-29 were installed in March 1994.  Two USTs were identified onsite, and four offsite USTs or former UST sites were discovered in the immediate vicinity of the site.  The investigation assessed the two onsite and two of the offsite USTs and found concentrations of concern in soil and groundwater at each.  One 10,000-gallon diesel UST (southwestern portion of site) had been removed in 1987.  Concentrations in UST confirmation soil samples collected at the time of removal of this UST are reported to have been non-detectable; however, the data is not currently available and subsequent sampling noted above document concentrations of concern.  Another 10,000-gallon UST was subsequently removed from western portion of the site in July 1994; it had previously been used to store gasoline and then diesel during separate periods.  Concentrations of concern were documented in removal confirmation soil and groundwater samples at the time of removal.  Wells MW-10 to MW-12 and bores B-41 to B-49 were installed in October 1994.  Wells MW-13 and MW-14 were installed in June 1995.  Overexcavation of soil in the vicinity of the two USTs occurred in October and November 1995.  In November 1995 soil bores B-50 to B-63 were installed in the vicinity of the former diesel UST.  In May 1996 pre-demolition sub-slab soil samples were collected in bores B-64 to B-89.  In July 1996 PNA soil samples were collected in bores B-96 and B-97.  A water supply well (a minimum of 90 feet deep) was destroyed in September 1996.  Approval to destroy wells MW-8, MW-9, MW-11, MW-13, and MW-14 was issued by ACEH in January 1997 due to parcel accesses agreement disputes with an adjacent parcel owner.  It is unclear if the wells were destroyed thereafter.  A Risk Assessment was submitted in December 1996, amended in August 1997, and accepted by ACEH in January 1998 wherein case closure was accepted with documentation of five conditions: generation of a Site Management Plan, assurance the SMP would be maintained in the future, submittal of a copy of the recorded deed notice, management of impacted media during future site redevelopment, destruction of 14 wells.  Preliminary documentation of these actions was not provided until July 2009 in response to a request for additional investigation; further documentation is required.    Case closed on 9\/22\/2010.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The property is currently occupied by Intrepid Electron Systems, Inc and is surrounded by commercial and residential land use.  It is reported that one fuel storage tank was installed at the site in 1980 and pumped dry in 1984 when abandoned.  The supply and return lines were then filled with concrete and capped.  Site lithology consists predominantly of silty sand to approximately 17.5 feet below ground surface (bgs); however, clayey silt can be present at a depth of 3 and 7 feet bgs.  Gravelly sand was also encountered between 14.5 and 17.5 feet bgs in one bore.  Silty clay is present below approximately 17.5 feet bgs.    On November 6, 1991, a 1,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tank (UST) was removed from the sidewalk in front of the property at 4377 Adeline Street.  There were no observable holes in the tank and it appeared to be in good condition.  Soil samples were collected from the excavation pit, piping trench, and soil stockpile.  The soil sample from the southern end of the excavation pit contained 230 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), 2.5 mg\/kg ethylbenzene, and 18.0 mg\/kg xylenes.  The only other sample that contained detectable concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons was collected from the middle of the excavation pit and contained no detectable concentration of TPHg, 0.0083 mg\/kg toluene, and 0.056 mg\/kg xylenes.  Overfill has been postulated by the removal company as the potential cause of the release.    On February 24, 2012, two soil borings (BH-A and BH-B) were advanced in the area of the former gasoline UST.  Two soil samples at 7.5 feet bgs and 11.5 feet bgs, and one groundwater sample were collected from each boring.  The soil samples contained TPH as diesel (TPHd) at concentrations up to 6.2 mg\/kg.  The greatest soil sample detection of TPHd came from the shallower soil sample, collected at 7.5 feet bgs in the northern boring.  The groundwater samples also contained TPHd at concentrations up to 340 micrograms per liter (µg\/l).  Since there were no detectable concentrations of TPHg in groundwater, the results indicate the possibility that the UST may have contained diesel.  None of the contaminants detected in soil during the 1991 tank excavation were detected during this event.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    On September 15, 2015, one approximately 2,000-gallon underground storage tank (UST) was removed from the site.  No holes were reported in the UST.  Groundwater was not encountered in the excavation.  One bottom sample was collected at a depth of 12 feet below surface grade (bgs) and four sidewall samples were collected from the excavation at a depth of approximately 8 feet bgs.  Concentrations up to 3.5 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), 350 mg\/kg TPH as diesel (TPHd), 280 mg\/kg TPH as oil (TPHo), 0.26 mg\/kg naphthalene, and 0.0073 mg\/kg ethylbenzene were detected from the sidewall samples.  Concentrations of 1.7 mg\/kg TPHg, 3,200 mg\/kg TPHd, 3,400 mg\/kg TPHo, 5.2 mg\/kg naphthalene, and 0.0092 ethylbenzene were detected from the stockpile samples.  The data indicate that an unauthorized release has occurred at the site.    Current Land-use at time of Closure  The subject site is located at the commercial East Bay Bridge Shopping Center in Emeryville, California.  The site is currently occupied by commercial establishments, and the subject UST was located in front of the commercial building currently occupied by the Sports Authority establishment.    Due to residual contamination from previous land uses, the current (subject) case was closed with site management requirements previously established by the previously existing case: “Yerba Buena – East Bay Bridge Center, T10000004342; RO0003093”.  These requirements include notifying Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) of a proposed change in land use to any residential or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment or building alteration is proposed that affect or disturb the existing subsurface conditions at the site, among others.  Closure of this case does not supersede existing land use restrictions.    Adjacent Property(ies) Land-use at Time of Closure  To the east and west are additional commercial buildings associated with the East Bay Bridge Shopping Center.  To the north of the UST location, across an expansive commercial parking lot, are multifamily residential units.  To the south is MacArthur Boulevard and the MacArthur Freeway (I-580).  The commercial buildings to the east and west, and the parking lot and residential units to the north are covered under one or more site closures with land use restrictions including ones associated with the “Yerba Buena – East Bay Bridge Center, T10000004342; RO0003093”, and  the “Ransome Company, T0600101124, RO0000049”.    There are no specific offsite impacts from the subject UST case.    Should off-site redevelopment occur, ACDEH recommends evaluating the redevelopment site(s) for chemicals of concern (COC) identified on this site, as established and managed under the Yerba Buena – East Bay Bridge Center case (T10000004342; RO0003093).  Land use restrictions for the current (subject) case do not supersede land use restrictions established for that case.    Historic Land-use \/ Site Investigation  The site was formerly used for industrial purposes consisting of railroad car repair and maintenance, automotive storage and repair, a trucking business, a railroad freight depot and passenger station, and general storage yards.  Previous site investigations in the 1980’s and 1990’s were conducted prior to redevelopment associated with the current commercial land use.  A Site Management Plan (SMP) was prepared in 1994 that provided protocols for on-going management of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil that was moved to, and placed on, the greater subject site and capped by the current development.  The upper approximately 4 to 5 feet of soil beneath the site is understood to be significantly contaminated by heavy-end Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH).  The San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) issued a No Further Action letter on June 6, 2002 for chlorinated solvent related contamination encountered beneath the site, and adjacent sites.  The ACDEH issued a No Further Action Letter on December 16, 2014 for petroleum related contamination (Yerba Buena – East Bay Bridge Center, T10000004342; RO0003093), which also established land use restrictions for the larger site.  A SMP Addendum to the 1994 SMP was prepared by the Cornerstone Earth Group in February 2, 2015 due to planned landscape improvements undertaken at that time.  The UST that is the subject of this case is a historic UST that was not discovered at the time of redevelopment, but was discovered at the time of the landscape improvements.    Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern  COC for this UST include Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline (TPHg), diesel (TPHd), heating oil (TPHho), and motor oil (TPHmo).  Very limited concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbon volatile compounds (PVOCs) were detected in soil, groundwater, or soil vapor.  Direct contact is the principal potential exposure route for the chemicals at the site.  Land use restrictions and the SMP were developed to manage these instances.    Pre-existing COC for the greater site due to past land uses included the COC listed above, and additionally include lead, benzo (a) pyrene, benzo (b) fluoranthene, and benzo (a) anthracene.  As before, land use restrictions and the SMP were developed to manage subsurface incursions.  Remediation Activities    Limited additional soil excavation was conducted to accommodate removal of the UST.  No remediation was otherwise conducted in association with this case.    Case Closure &amp; Future Site Management Requirements   The subject site was evaluated to the criteria established by the State Water Board’s LTCP.  The site meets all eight General Criteria.  Utilizing existing groundwater data generated during the current site investigation as well as from pre-re-development environmental investigations, the site meets Groundwater Criteria 1 (Groundwater plume is less than 100 feet in length, there is no free product, and the nearest existing water supply well is greater than 250 feet from the site).  The site additionally meets the Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air Criteria and the Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Exposure Criteria.  Residual contamination documented beneath the subject UST is significantly less, and vertically defined, than residual contamination from the pre-existing case.    Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements established by the Yerba Buena – East Bay Bridge Center, T10000004342; RO0003093 case.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.

Eastshore Park extends from the Emeryville Crescent in the south to Point Isabel in the north, and falls within five different cities (Oakland, Emeryville, Berkeley, Albany, and Richmond).    The acreage was transferred from Catellus Development Co. to the California Department of Parks and Recreation and the East Bay Regional Park District in 1999 following a two-year escrow period, during which the Board oversaw site investigation and cleanup.  Cleanup involved excavation of contaminated shallow soil at 17 locations (total of 4,600 cubic yards) with clean-soil backfill.  This is in addition to a sediment cleanup at Point Isabel in the 1980s which resulted in some lead-impacted soil being managed onsite in the upland portion of the parcel.    Cleanup is regulated by two SCRs – one for Emeryville Crescent and one for the remainder of the park acreage.  The SCRs require active cleanup (completed in 1998) and ongoing risk management (cap maintenance at Point Isabel and shoreline erosion control).",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "A Phase I assessment completed in 1993 detected the presence of six USTs associated with the former service station. A Phase II investigation completed in August 1993 detected significantly elevated levels of TPHg and benzene in soil.  In May 1994, six UST were removed and holes were noted in two of the USTs. Confirmation soil sampling detected elevated levels of contamination in soil in the former tank pit. In January 1995 interim remedial action was completed and 2,300 cubic yards of contaminated soil was removed and disposed offsite.  Additional site characterization was completed in 2006 and 2007 to evaluate the lateral extent of contamination.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The subject site is one of seven sites with a co-mingled soil and groundwater contaminant plumes sites (Oakland National Engravers; RO0000079; Dunne Quality Paints; RO0000073; San Francisco French Bread Company; RO0000171; Celis Service Station; RO0000453; SNK Andante; RO0002530; Oak Walk; RO0002733, and Magnolia Terrace; RO0003004).  The groundwater contaminant plume extends a minimum distance of approximately 1,200 feet in length (see paleochannel figure).  The soil and groundwater plumes appear to have moved through a series of granular paleochannels (with significant interconnectivity) that is present beneath the sites.    The subject site appears to have contributed significant residual contamination to the Oak Walk site (RO0002733).  A Corrective Action Plan (CAP) had previously been generated and fully implemented for the Oak Walk site after a required 30-day public participation period was conducted.  Unfortunately the remedial efforts at Oak Walk were not successful in meeting the stated CAP objectives and ACEH requested further a further remedial effort in November 2011.  Groundwater concentrations on the adjacent Oak Walk site in September 2010 were up to 1,800 µg\/l TPHd, 3,400 µg\/l TPHms, 49,000 µg\/l TPHg, and 14,000 µg\/l benzene (and included other standard fuel related compounds).  In March 2012, concentrations up to 2,200 µg\/l TPHd, 3,500 µg\/l TPHms, 26,000 µg\/l TPHg, and 9,500 µg\/l benzene were present.  These groundwater concentrations indicate that a significant residual source remains at, or in proximity to, the Oak Walk site.    Please be aware that the extent of contaminant migration from the Celis Service Station site on to the adjacent SNK Andante Project site (RO0002530) appears to have been partly controlled by very old abandoned foundational elements that apparently allowed free-phase and groundwater with elevated concentrations to migrate into and beneath that site.  While speculative, this may have been an element of contaminant migration into the Oak Walk site (RO0002733) from the Celis site.  Please also be aware that the presence of MTBE beneath Oak Walk may tie this contamination to the Celis Service Station as MTBE is generally not seen at the San Francisco Bread Company (RO0000171) site.  Finally please be aware that rather than the submittal of an updated CAP, a risk assessment was submitted for the Oak Walk site in response to the request for further remedial efforts.",

The plant was demolished during redevelopment in 1988 and included the removal of six USTs, six sumps, seven ASTs, and a 350-foot water-supply well with 24 feet of free phase at that time.  Between September 1987 and January 1988 ten soil bores (BH-1 to BH-10; hand augers) and three wells (MW-1 to MW-3) were installed.  In May and June 1989 soil bore B-1 and wells five additional wells (MW-1 to MW-5) were installed.  The status of the first set of three wells (MW-1 to MW-3) is unknown.  In July 1994 bores B2 to B4 were installed around MW-2 (second generation well).  In August 1999 five hydropunch bores (HP-1 to HP-5) were installed to investigate shallow groundwater, and one CPT bore was installed to investigate deep groundwater.  In addition to five shallow grab groundwater samples, deep groundwater samples were collected from two depth intervals (78 – 103 and 135 - 160 feet).  In January 2007 four wells were destroyed (MW-1, MW-3, MW-4, and MW-5) and five wells were installed (TR-1 to TR-5).  At present FP delineation is underway.

From 1963 to 1979 the site was occupied by Dymo Industries, a lable tape and lable tape punch manufacturer.  Dymo used and stored MIBK and MEK in six USTs at the site.  From 1979 to 1989 Mike Roberts Color Production occupied the site and manufactured and printed color postcards and expanded to color printing, lithography, and off-set printing using inks, solvents cleaning compounds and color pigments.  Beginning in 1990 Nady Systems occupied the site, largely using it as a warehouse.  Six areas of environmental concern were identified and investigated at the site and up to 10 wells and 15 soil bores have been installed at the site.    Recent redevelopment interest started in approximately 2015, and since that time over 67 soil vapor wells, 62 soil bores, 19 soil vapor extraction wells, 12 sub-slab vapor points have been installed.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "From 1952 to 1989, chromium plating operations occurred at the 1401 Park Avenue property. Nickel plating activities were conducted at the 1421 Park Avenue property starting in the late 1950s to 1999. Site operations have included metal stripping, chrome plating, and nickel plating. Liquid metal-plating wastes were discharged into an on-site shallow (approximately 20 feet) disposal well until 1965, until wastes were discharged into a concrete-lined sump in the location of the former well. In 1977, chromium-impacted groundwater was discovered in an excavation pit near the site, and the concrete sump was subsequently reinforced with a double concrete liner, and a steel tank was placed into the sump.  A vapor degreasing tank was used prior to nickel-plating activities, and trichloroethene (TCE) and later 1,1,1-trichloroethane were used as degreasers. All degreasing operations were performed at the southwest portion of the 1421 Park Avenue property.    The Water Board issued a cleanup and abatement order (CAO) 77-011 to immediately abate discharges of wastewater from the subject property. From 1995 to 1999, injections of a proprietary blend of non-petroleum organic compounds, bio-nutrients, and microbial inoculants were used to reduce concentrations of hexavalent chromium and TCE in groundwater. Due to the successes of these injections, the CAO was rescinded in 2000. A deed restriction and soil management plan has been recorded for the 1401 Park Avenue property. Following the cleanup of the 1401 Park Avenue property, remediation efforts shifted to 1421 Park Avenue, as well as 4050 Horton Street, and the Holden Street right of way. An additional CAO was issued (R2-2006-0027) to remediate residual off-site chromium contamination in the Holden Street right of way. Soil excavations required by the CAO were completed in 2007.    A mixed use commercial and residential building currently occupies the 1401 Park Avenue parcel. The 1421 Park Avenue portion of the Site was also occupied by various commercial and service businesses until some of the buildings were demolished sometime between 1998 and 2003, and approximately 2017",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The 17-acre Yerba Buena\/ East Bay Bridge Center (YB\/EBBC) fuel leak case was opened on October 9, 2012 by Alameda County Environmental Health (ACEH) to address impacts associated with this project.  Documents historically associated with this fuel leak case were originally place in fuel leak case RO0000049 -Ransome Company.  The Ransome Company fuel leak case was used as the sole repository for all documents for the greater 52-acre redevelopment project named the East Baybridge Center (EBC).    The YB\/EBBC property was owned by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe (AT&amp;SF) Railway Company.  Through mergers, acquisitions, and spinoffs, the AT&amp;SF transferred land holdings to a subsidiary, the Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corporation (SFPRC), and then to Catellus Development Corporation (Catellus), a SFPRC subsidiary.  Catellus became independent from SFPRC in 1990.  Catellus developed the approximate 17-acre YB\/EBBC property as part of a larger 52-acre EBC redevelopment project.  Catellus merged with ProLogis in 2005.  The project at the time of the ProLogis merger was identified as the “East Bay Bridge Shopping Center”.  The current owner is Federal Reality Investment Trust, dba East Bay Bridge Retail LLC.     The portion of the EBC comprising the Yerba Buena\/ East bay Bridge Center consists of three parcels having APNs 49-619-2, 49-619-3, and 49-619-5.  The YB\/EBBC site is bounded by West MacArthur Boulevard to the south, Emery Street to the east and Hollis Street to the west and the Bridecourt apartment complex, which fronts 40th Street, to the north.  The YB\/EBBC property is commercially developed with approximately 215,000 sq ft of “tilt-up” single-story retail space and about 380,000 sq. ft. of paved parking.  The YB\/EBBC consists of three parcels and occupies pre-development regions known as former Area A and the southwestern portion of Area B.  The separation of the former Areas A and B was the east-west trending Yerba Buena Avenue.  The YB\/EBBC site does not include the portions of Area A and Area B east of Emery Street or the portion off Area B fronting 40th Street occupied by the Bridgecourt Apartments.    Records indicate that prior to the current development, the most recent tenants of the YB\/EBBC property were Santa Fe Terminal Services (SFTS), operating on the western portion of Area A, Clipper Exxpress Company (Clipper), which operated an approximately 60,000 sq-ft warehouse located in the south eastern portion of the site, and LDS warehouse located on the southern portion of Area B.  The Clipper and LDS warehouses were leased from the SFPRC and were serviced by railroad spurs along the northern side of their respective warehouses.  Clipper operated from the 1960s and LDS operated from about 1980. Operations continued until about 1990 when the warehouses were demolished.   Operations at Clipper included carloading, material storage (including quantities of oxides, acid rinse, and chlorinated alkaline cleaner) and freight transfer.  Clipper operated a diesel 10,000-gallon UST.  Operations at LDS included carloading, material storage and freight transfer, and truck rental.  SFTS occupied the western portion of the property by the 1970s and used it for storage of truck trailers on un-paved ground.    Though no documentation of tank operations were reported, two heating oil USTs were encountered on the SFTS portion of the property during preparation for site redevelopment.        Historical documentation indicates that from at least 1911 to 1925, the Area A portion of the YB\/EBBC property was the site of railcar repair and maintenance shops associated with the Oakland Traction Company, the Key System Limited, the Key System Transit lines, and the East Bay Transit Company.  During this period Area A contained a number of buildings that housed a variety of operations, including foundries, car repair and painting, paint and oil storage, a blacksmith shop and engine room, auto and bus repair, and a sheet metal workshop.  The eastern portion of Area A was occupied in 1931 and 1940 by an auto storage and wrecking yard, a print shop and a hay and grain warehouse.  By 1959 all the buildings had been destroyed.  The LDS warehouse was constructed circa 1910 while the Clipper warehouse was built in the in the late 1960s.  The LDS and Clipper buildings were demolished 1990 in preparation for future site redevelopment.    Environmental investigations were conducted from 1989 through 1991 and included a review of recent and historical usage of the site, a review of previous investigations, several rounds of intrusive investigations for the recovery of soil and water samples for laboratory analysis, a soil gas survey, and water sampling that included grab-groundwater samples recovered from soil borings, samples collected from groundwater monitoring wells, and samples collected from open excavations.  In addition, three underground storage tanks were removed from the site.       The Clipper diesel 10,000-gallon UST was removed in November 1990 by a contractor working on Clipper’s behalf.  Analysis of excavation floor and sidewall samples indicated concentrations less than 18 ppm TPHd and total petroleum hydrocarbons as oil (TPHo) and ND for BTEX.  ACHA letter (January 24, 1991) approved excavation backfilling and did not request further investigation or cleanup.  SFTS occupied the western portion of the property by the 1970s and used it for storage of truck trailers on un-paved ground.      Site characterization studies were conducted from 1989 through 1991.  The results of the soils investigations revealed the presence of concentrations of up to 14,000 mg\/kg TPHo.   Toluene and ethyl benzene were reported at concentrations up to 0.29 mg\/kg and 0.019 mg\/kg, respectively.   Pyrene was reported in one sample at a concentration of 0.39 mg\/kg.   Concentrations of TPHg, TPHd, benzene, and xylenes were documented below the laboratory reporting limit for the site soils.   Maximum metals concentrations included As up to 26 mg\/kg, Cd 2.8 mg\/kg, Cr to 58 mg\/kg, Ni to 68 mg\/kg, Cu to 640 mg\/kg, Pb to 1,400 mg\/kg, and Zn to 410 mg\/kg.   Delineation of the lead impacted area indicated it was localized, and in June 1991, approximately 360 cubic yards of lead-impacted soil was excavated and transported to a US Ecology facility near Beatty, Nevada for disposal.  Confirmation samples contained residual lead concentrations of up to 150 mg\/kg.  The excavation was backfilled with clean aggregate base import material.  Subsequent mass grading resulted in dispersing the residual pockets of elevated metals.    Site cleanup criteria were established with Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (ACHA), predecessor to the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) in January 1991.  The cleanup criteria consisted of 1,000 mg\/kg total oil and grease (TOG), 100 mg\/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), 10 mg\/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and 1 mg\/kg benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes (BTEX) (combined).   A 1992 revision to the clean up levels reduce the benzene concentration to non-detect.  Clean up levels for metals were their respective Total Threshold Limit Concentrations (TTLCs).    Grab groundwater samples recovered during the site characterization studies documented up to 200 ug\/l TPHg.  The grab groundwater samples tested below the laboratory reporting limits for TPHd, TPHo, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) compounds.  Metals in the grab groundwater samples were to contain up to 3 ug\/L arsenic (As), 1,000 ug\/L nickel (Ni), selenium (Se) to 3 ug\/L, and zinc (Zn) up to 26 ug\/L.     Three shallow (screened to or above 25 feet below the ground surface- bgs) on-site groundwater monitoring wells, LF-3, LF-4, and LF-6, were installed during January 1990.  Three additional shallow monitoring wells were installed in April 1990– (LF-17, LF-18, and LF-19) in the down gradient direction of LF-4.  Two wells were installed to monitor deeper (intermediate) groundwater and establish vertical hydraulic gradients, were installed in the vicinity of LF-4 and LF-5, and designated LF-4D and LF-5D, respectively. LF-4D and LF-5D were screened in the interval of 29-feet to 39 feet bgs and 44 feet to 34 feet bgs, respectively.  A third well, LF-4Z, was installed in the vicinity of LF-4 for the purpose of monitoring groundwater underlying LF-4D.  Well LF-4Z was screened at the interval of 52 feet to 62 feet bgs.  One intermediate (19D) well was installed in July 1991.  LF-19D was installed adjacent to LF-19, but screened deeper (between 31 feet and 45 feet bgs).   The two shallow wells were installed down gradient of the LF-19, just west of former Area A.      TPH compound analysis was limited to a few wells (LF-3, LF-4, LF-5, and LF-19) and performed for extractable range hydrocarbons only on a semiannual basis.  Maximum concentrations of TPHd and TPHo reported in the pre-grading wells were 334 ug\/L and 380 ug\/L, respectively.   TPHg concentrations were not reported above the laboratory reporting limits in any of the pre-grading monitoring wells.  Pre-grading groundwater levels at YB\/EBBC ranged from 4.41 feet bgs to 19.83 feet bgs.  The on-site LF-designated groundwater monitoring wells were destroyed in July 1993 in preparation of grading activities.      In accordance with the Soil Containment Plan, stockpiled TPH-impacted soil from the greater 52-acre EBC project was placed as engineered fill throughout the YB\/EBBC property.  Other than the heavier ranged petroleum hydrocarbons, the stockpiled soil met the 10 mg\/kg TPHg, 1 mg\/kg toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (TEX) (combined), and the non-detect benzene concentration criteria.  After placement, the soil would be capped by impermeable asphaltic concrete pavement or be covered by building pads.  Residual concentrations of TPHd, TPHo, and TOG, documented up to 260 mg\/kg, 4,400 mg\/kg, and 18,000 mg\/kg, respectively, were left in place at the site.   In July 1994, replacement shallow wells MW -3 through MW-9, intermediate wells MW-6D, MW-7D and MW-9D, and deeper well MW-7Z were installed in the approximate locations of the LF-designated wells to monitor effects to groundwater due to the placement of TPH-impacted soil.      Post-grading groundwater levels ranging from 8.51 feet bgs to 17.15 feet bgs.  Maximum concentrations of TPHg, TPHd, and TPHo reported during the final year (2001) for the post-grading monitoring wells were &lt;50 ug\/L, 88 ug\/L and &lt;200 ug\/L, respectively.  TPHg\/d\/o and BTEX concentrations were not reported above the laboratory reporting limits in any intermediate or deep of the pre- or post-grading monitoring wells.  Based on the groundwater investigations it was determined the groundwater quality was not significantly affected by the presence of the heavy TPH fraction in the soil in spite of the relatively shallow groundwater.  A review of the data trend over the seven years of groundwater monitoring revealed decreasing TPHg concentrations – reported as high as 200 ug\/L in B-4 on January 26, 1990 to &lt;50 ug\/L (in well MW-3) for the final groundwater monitoring event conducted on December 7, 2001,    and a stable- to decreasing TPHd concentrations reported as high as 334 ug\/L in EX-4 on December 17, 1996 to 88 ug\/L in MW-7 during the final year of groundwater monitoring (August 15, 2001).  Concentrations of benzene, ethyl benzene, and naphthalene were not reported above laboratory reporting limits in any of the groundwater samples recovered at the site during the eleven years of groundwater sampling.    The RWQCB was the lead agency for a separate case at the YB-EBB site, which was open between 1992 and 2002.  Volatile organic compound (VOC) -affected groundwater was identified in former Area A and southern portion of former Area B.  The RWQCB case for the VOCs is not associated with Alameda County’s LUST case.  The RWQCB listed the site as the East Baybridge Center, Yerba Buena and Hollis, Emeryville, Alameda County, RWQCB file number is 01S0226, and Global ID of T0600191518.  The RWQCB issued a No Further Action letter in June 2002.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "A 750-gallon UST was removed in August 1994 and two tank bottom samples were collected.  The samples, collected at a depth of 8.5 feet bgs, documented concentrations of 4,200 mg\/kg TPHg and 0.22 mg\/kg benzene.  A work plan for the installation of wells was submitted in January 1995, but does not appear to have been implemented.  In April 1995 approximately 90 cubic yards of soil were excavated, and four sidewall samples and an excavation bottom sample were collected.  Concentrations of 5,200 mg\/kg TPH as gasoline, 580 mg\/kg TPH as diesel, and 24 mg\/kg benzene were documented in the excavation bottom sample, collected at a depth of 9 feet bgs.  Excavated soil was manifested and disposed at Forward Landfill in Manteca, California.  Another work plan was submitted in January 1998 and detailed a different scope of work; however, no reports to document the work were submitted.  In August 2007 a work plan was submitted, and subsequently approved with modifications in October 2007.  In December 2007 a soil and groundwater investigation report was submitted and documented the installation of Geoprobe bores SGW-1 to SGW-6 around the former tank excavation for the purpose of collecting soil and grab groundwater samples.  Concentrations up to 1,300 mg\/kg TPH as gasoline, 320 mg\/kg TPH as diesel, and 0.97 mg\/kg benzene were reported in soil,  while up to 830 µg\/L TPH as gasoline, 730 µg\/L TPH as diesel, and 24 µg\/L benzene were detected in grab groundwater samples.  Soil samples collected beneath the former UST excavation encountered 4.3 ppm TPHg and 2.8 ppm TPHd at a depth of 11.5 feet bgs.  No additional work has been conducted.",

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Beginning in February 1981 portions of the site have been analyzed for PCB contamination tied to the former Westinghouse Parcel I facility on the southern property line of the subject site.  Elevated concentrations were found in shallow soil in June 1981 along the southwestern boundary adjacent to a railroad spur.  In 1985 the RWQCB issued a Cleanup &amp; Abatement Order to Westinghouse and ultimately 35-foot deep slurry wall was constructed along the northern &amp; eastern boundaries of the site having greater than 50 ppm PCB.  PCB soil was excavated from the subject site and moved to within the wall and an engineered CAP was installed (on the property to the immediate south).  In 1992 environmental investigations for the then proposed USPS building began.  In January 1992, 10 soil bores and one well (MW-1) were installed; PCBs, TPHd and TPHk were encountered.  In June 1993, 46 vapor probes and 25 soil bores (four converted to groundwater wells) were installed and hydrocarbons at concentrations of concern were discovered.  It was found that the site had been used as an oil distribution facility by Shell Oil and Guardian Oil in the 1930s, with 10 ASTs in the SE corner of the site and 4 ASTs in the SW corner of the site.  Free-phase was also encountered.  In July and August 1993 two USTs were removed from the central and southern areas of the site, a third UST was later discovered along the northern property line, and a number of product lines were removed and sampled (all with residual hydrocarbon concentrations).  The rail siding along the western property line was also excavated and elevated hydrocarbon and PCB concentrations were documented.  Groundwater monitoring is documented between October 1994 and July 1995.  Additional PCB remediation appears to have been conducted under RWQCB oversight; however, UST issues are reported not to have been included in the oversight.  The historic address associated with the site (6121 Hollis Street) appears to be incorrect and is reported to have been due to former temporary use of the 6121 address by the USPS; the address associated with the site was changed in April 2010.",

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The site is a senior residential board and care facility located at the corner of 40th Street and Horton Street in Emeryville, CA.  Surrounding land use is commercial.  Soils observed during the excavation were primarily clay.  A heating oil underground storage tank (UST) was installed on the property at an unknown date.  On June 18, 2008, the 500-gallon heating oil underground storage tank was removed from the property.  The bottom of the tank was measured to be at 6.5 feet below ground surface (bgs).  Product piping that extended from the top of the tank beneath the former building was not found.  Prior to removal, residual product was pumped and the tank was triple rinsed.  A water sample was also collected from tank rinsate.  The tank was observed to be in poor condition, with at least one observable hole.  Visible staining and odors were also noted in the soil underlying the tank.  Groundwater was not encountered during the excavation.  Soil samples were collected beneath the tank at each end (9006-N-8.5 and 9006-S-8.5) along with one four-point composite sample (9006-SP(A-D)) from the soil stockpile.    Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel, motor oil, kerosene, and stoddard solvent were not detected in the two soil samples collected beneath the UST at a depth of 6.5 feet below surface grade (bgs).  The soil samples were additionally analyzed for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and none were detected.  A tank rinsate sample contained 1,600 parts per billion (ppb) TPH as motor oil, and was noted during analysis to also contain heating oil.  The stockpile composite sample contained 5 ppm lead.  The UST excavation was subsequently overexcavated to 8.5’ for building construction.  Additional confirmation sampling was not performed and the building was constructed over the UST location.  It appears that residual contamination that may be present was removed to a depth of 8.5 feet bgs.    Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal and overexcavation and groundwater analysis was not performed prior to redevelopment of the site.  The site has been redeveloped and the closest downgradient accessible sampling location is approximately 95’ to 100’ from the former UST location so groundwater sampling is not possible at or immediately downgradient of the former UST location.  Heating oil typically contains trace to low levels of BTEX and overexcavation likely removed any contamination present to the 8.5’ bgs depth.  Therefore, additional characterization and groundwater sampling was not performed.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Prior to the 1930’s the site was in the San Francisco Bay; until the early 1950’s the site was a part of the City of Emeryville municipal waste landfill.  The site has been a commercial facility since at least the 1960's.  Three adjacent USTs were removed between August and October 1989 (one diesel in August, two gasoline USTs in October); black petroleum product is reported to have flowed from the south wall of the excavation adjacent to the diesel UST.  An estimated 2,000 gallons of product was removed from the excavations.  Limited overexcavation may have occurred between August 1989 and February 1990 when the excavations were backfilled; the records are unclear.  Impacts to soil and groundwater have been characterized as oil and grease, extractable hydrocarbons (TPHd), purgeable hydrocarbons (TPHg), and BTEX.  In January 1990 seven bores were installed (B-1 to B-7).  Two offsite wells (adjacent property; MW-5 and MW-7; 50 to 75 feet distant) have been used since 1989 in an attempt to help define groundwater.  The wells were sampled regularly between November 1989 and June 1997.  In June 1996 six soil bores (SB-1 to SB-6) were installed.  Preferential pathway and sensitive receptor surveys were conducted in May 2010.  Soil bores SB-7 to SB-9 were also installed to collect soil samples, and soil bores GGW-1 to GGW-4 were installed to collect grab groundwater samples.  In December 2011 four sub-slab vapor points were installed and sampled beneath the building located at the site, and at the offsite downgradient building.  An additional sub-slab vapor was collected approximately six months later in May 2012 beneath the downgradient building.  A third vapor monitoring round at the downgradient building was conducted in December 2014.    The site appears eligible for closure under the LTCP.  It meets all General Criteria.  The site qualifies for closure under Class 5 of the Groundwater Media Specific Criteria due to the presence of free product in pockets in soil in the vicinity of the former USTs.  Additionally, based on grab groundwater sample concentrations free product (LNAPL) may also be present in limited qualities in groundwater on- and offsite in close proximity to the former UST locations.  This LNAPL does not appear to be mobile based on analytical concentrations in wells MW-5 and MW-7 that are located between the former UST excavation and the downgradient offsite building.  Consequently a commercial \/ industrial land use restriction has been placed on the subject property.  Additionally a pre-existing commercial \/ industrial land use restriction was placed on the adjacent downgradient property at the time of the closure of that UST case (Emery Bay Plaza, RO0000440; T0600100511) and is expected to manage contamination at that offsite downgradient location.  The site meets the Vapor Intrusion Media Specific Criteria by Class 2c, controlling exposure by use of mitigation measures and institutional controls.  The site also meets the Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Criteria by meeting the concentrations contained in Table 1 of the LTCP.

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Two 2,000-gallon USTs (one diesel, one unleaded gasoline) were removed in July 1996; limited overexcavation was conducted about a week later.  Seven Geoprobe soil bores were proposed to be installed in April 1998; however, three Geoprobe bores were actually installed in May 1998 due to deeper than expected groundwater and a gravel layer causing rig refusal.  A pre-existing monitoring well (for the former Clear Print site, a now closed, non-fuel related site) has produced elevated concentrations of TPHg, benzene, and MTBE, suggestive of free-phase (the well was not destroyed and given for use by the McGrath site; all other Clear Print wells have been destroyed).  In September 2005 an additional work plan was approved.  In December 2005, seven Geoprobe bores were installed and soil and grab groundwater samples were collected.  Between September 2011 and December 2013, up to 3 feet of Free Phase (FP) was present in well MW-3.  As of February 2014 FP in well MW-3 has been diminished; however, wells have not been sample since March 2014, and FP appears to return to the well with deeper groundwater levels than present in March 2014.  In January 2013 soil bores B-15 to B-25 were installed, and subsequently wells AMW-1 to AMW-3 were installed in August 2013.   The more recent work appears to have defined the northern lateral downgradient extent of the groundwater plume between Clear Print and the McGrath site; however, the apparent primary downgradient extent to the southwest and beneath adjacent property buildings, as based on the established groundwater flow direction, has not been defined.    November 2014 and June 2015 indoor air sampling events have occurred at the two adjacent probable downgradient properties that appear to indicate slightly elevated indoor air BTEX vapor concentrations are present above RWQCB ESLs and above outdoor air background samples.  This data indicates a potential vapor intrusion risk at and downgradient of the site.  The generation of explosive levels of methane from the decomposition of petroleum is additionally of concern beneath the subject site building and adjacent downgradient buildings.  Based on the depth to groundwater, there does not appear to be a bioattenuation zone beneath the sites.  Interim Remedial Actions have been proposed and approved based on the potential for vapor intrusion at and downgradient of the site.  An expansion of the interim system has been discussed and is likely to be proposed to address contamination at the downgradient edge of the property (December 2018).",

Previous releases from underground storage tanks (USTs) were regulated under fuel leak case RO0000067 which was closed by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) in May 2014 under the State Water Resources Control Board’s Low Threat Closure Policy (LTCP) with a commercial service station restriction and requirements to notify ACDEH if any redevelopment occurred.  The site was not evaluated for risk of vapor intrusion due to the LTCP commercial service station exemption.  Subsequent to closure, the property owner converted the western portion of the station into commercial non-service station land use as a restaurant without notifying ACDEH of the change in land use.  This case was opened to evaluate the risk of vapor intrusion to the newly converted restaurant tenant space.    Due to the shallowness of groundwater and the inability to collect vapor samples five feet below the building foundation at the site sub-slab vapor, indoor air, and outside air ambient samples were collected and evaluated, and confirmed that the vapor intrusion risk to the restaurant tenant space presents a low risk of vapor intrusion to building occupants.",

Information can be found at https:\/\/www.envirostor.dtsc.ca.gov\/public\/profile_report.asp?global_id=01490011   The site has served as a warehouse, repair shop and storage yard for transformers, capacitors, and other electrical supplies. In the 1980s and early 1990s, PG&amp;E removed above ground storage tanks (ASTs) and underground storage tanks (USTs). A portion of the Materials Distribution Center north of 53rd Street was purchased by Chiron Corporation in the early 1990's and is now utilized by Chiron's successor, Novartis. At the Novartis portion of the site, a Removal Action Workplan (RAW) was implemented by 1996 which involved excavation and disposal of 10,100 tons of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Starting in 2007, PG&amp;E coordinated environmental investigations at the southern portion of the site and identified metals, PCBs, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hydrocarbons. A RAW was prepared in 2017 to address human health concerns primarily related to exposure to VOCs in groundwater, soil vapor, air, and indoor air. The cleanup approach is to remove VOCs with vapor extraction technology, possibly conduct in situ treatment of groundwater and restrict usage of the site with a Land Use Covenant. The startup of the vapor extraction system occurred in the spring of 2018. In addition PG&amp;E proposed capping landscaped areas where elevated levels of arsenic, lead and PCBs were identified.    On behalf of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E), ERM-West, Inc. (ERM) prepared a Soil Management Plan (SMP) for PG&amp;E Materials Facility at 4525 Hollis Street in Emeryville, California. The SMP covers the “Plan Area” (Figure 2) which consists of the entire Facility (Assessor’s Parcel Numbers 49-1041-29-2, 49-1041-61, 49-1032-13, and 49-1032-14) and remediation  areas, in accordance with California Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC)-approved Removal Action Workplan (RAW; ERM 2017d).  This introductory section summarizes the definitions used in the SMP, site background and remediation activities conducted at the Facility, identifies the users and applicability of this SMP, describes the SMP objectives, and presents the SMP organization. Parties conducting Work within the Plan Area are responsible for complying with any applicable federal,  state, and local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to: requirements of the City of Emeryville, Alameda County, DTSC, Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) , federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), California OSHA, any National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit(s), and Underground Service Alert of Northern California (USA North). A comprehensive listing of laws and regulations applicable to specific future work is outside of the scope of the SMP. The measures presented in the SMP are based on the current understanding of environmental conditions at the Facility and the measures currently understood to be necessary and appropriate for those conditions. If actual environmental conditions are found to differ from those described herein, or different or additional measures are deemed necessary and appropriate, the SMP may have to be modified. The SMP may not be modified without written approval from DTSC.",

USTs 16-1, 16-2, and 16-3 have capacities of 100,000 gallons each and measure 42 feet in diameter by 10 feet deep. UST 16-4 has a capacity of 210,000 gallons and measures 53 feet in diameter by 13 feet deep. USTs 16-1 and 16-4 contained JP-3 jet fuel; UST 16-2 contained 91\/96 aviation fuel; and UST 16-3 contained 115\/145 aviation fuel. USTs 16-1, 16-2, 16-3, and 16-4 were also identified as UST-8, UST-7, UST-6, and UST-5, respectively, in previous reports. Each of the USTs was destroyed in place and backfilled with gravel and\/or soil.    AOC-13 consists of the former location of Building 16, which housed the pump and meter for aviation fuel storage activities (FA\/BC 2003). The pump and meter house, constructed in 1944, serviced the four USTs that are located in AOC-3. This building was equipped with a rack for loading aviation fuel trucks. A release of petroleum hydrocarbons could have occurred during routine operations at this facility.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently an operating 76 station dispensing gasoline and diesel fuels and operating a car wash.  The waste oil tank and hydraulic hoists associated with the facility were removed by April 1995, the station building demolished, and a convenience store replaced the area formerly occupied by the service bays.       In October 1991, four soil samples were collected from the product pipe trenches at depths of approximately 3 feet below ground surface (bgs) during a dispenser island modification.  Concentrations of up to 8,400 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as diesel (TPHd) to 8,400 mg\/kg, TPH as gasoline (TPHg) to 9,000 mk\/kg, and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (collectively BTEX) at 48, 410, 330, and 1,500 mg\/kg, respectively.  The product pipe trenches were subsequently excavated to the groundwater depth at 4 to 4.5 feet bgs.  Three on-site groundwater monitoring wells, MW�]1 through MW�]3, were installed at the site in February 1992.  Maximum soil concentrations reported for the well bores were reported up to 2,400 mg\/kg TPHd, 14,000 mg\/kg TPHg, and BTEX to 160, 680, 2,400, and 470 mg\/kg, respectively.  Initial groundwater sampling revealed the presence of up to 13,000 micrograms per liter (ug\/L) TPHd, 150,000 ug\/L TPHg, and BTEX to 17,000, 26,000, 5,200, and 26,000 ug\/L, respectively.  Three additional on-site wells, MW�]4 through MW�]6, installed in August 1992.  These six wells were installed to monitor shallow groundwater.  In September 1994, one 280�]gallon waste�]oil underground storage tank (WOT) was removed from the site. No apparent holes or cracks were observed in the WOT.  One soil sample was collected from beneath the location of the former WOT at a depth of approximately 9 feet bgs. TPHd, TPHg, and BTEX compounds were reported below the laboratory reporting limits.  In January 1995, two additional on-site monitoring wells, MW�]9 and MW�]10, were installed to monitor shallow groundwater, and two wells, MW�]4 and MW�]5, were destroyed in order to accommodate the installation of a car wash.     In March 1995, two 10,000�]gallon gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs) and one 10,000�]gallon diesel UST were removed from the site.  Groundwater was encountered in the tank cavity at a depth of approximately 8.5 feet bgs.  Soil samples collected from the tank pit contained total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as diesel (TPHd), benzene, and TPH as gasoline (TPHg).  Approximately 6,444 cu yds soil excavated and disposed off-site.  Additionally, approximately 125,000 gallons of groundwater were pumped from the tank pit and reported to have been disposed off-site.  Initial pit water analysis revealed the presence of 31,000 micrograms per liter (ug\/L) TPHg and BTEX at 4,000, 4,400, 1,100, and 3,600 ug\/L, respectively.  The four fuel dispenser islands and associated product piping were also removed.  Based on the results of the confirmation samples, the soil beneath the product dispenser islands was over excavated to approximately 6 feet bgs.      During demolition activities of the former station building in March�-April 1995, soil samples were collected from two excavations, which were subsequently over excavated. Confirmation samples contained petroleum hydrocarbons. An additional area on the south side of the former station building was excavated based on photo�]ionization detector (PID) readings.  Two monitoring wells, MW�-1 and MW�-2, were destroyed in order to allow for over excavation activities to extend to an area adjacent to the dispenser islands in the southeastern quadrant of the site. The excavated areas were subsequently backfilled with clean� engineered fill.  MW-1 was reported to contain free phase product following it�fs initial monitoring event.  In April 1997, two additional monitoring wells, MW�]7 and MW�]8, were installed off�-site to the south and west on an adjacent property to a depth of 13 feet bgs to monitor shallow groundwater.  In addition, monitoring well MW�]3, which was damaged during site demolition activities, was drilled out and replaced.  In April 8�-9, 2005, a 24�-hour dual phase extraction (DPE) test at the site using monitoring well MW�-6.  The 24�-hour DPE test was only moderately successful at removing vapor�]phase petroleum hydrocarbons from the subsurface; hence, DPE was not considered to be a viable remedial alternative for the site.      In April 2006, a sensitive receptor survey was conducted consisting of a review of Department of Water Resources (DWR) record. According to the DWR records, there are two irrigation wells and one industrial well located within one�-half mile of the site. The nearest well, is an irrigation well located approximately 1,080 feet southeast of the site. The other irrigation well is located approximately 2,623 feet southeast of the site, and the industrial well is located approximately 2,570 feet northeast of the site.  Two surface water bodies were observed within a one�-half mile radius of the site- the San Leandro Creek, located approximately 1,400 feet southwest of the site and flows into the San Leandro Bay and Elmhurst Creek, located approximately 2,220 feet north of the site, also flows into the San Leandro Bay.      In December 2009, two borings, B�]4 and B�]5, were advanced to depths of 20 feet bgs and 32 feet bgs, respectively, to evaluate deeper groundwater zones.  Analytical results from the soil and groundwater samples collected from these two borings indicated that the soil and groundwater were impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons at these locations.  Soil samples from bore B-4 were shown to contain maximum concentrations of TPH at the 6-foot bgs sample and bore B-5 in both the 8-foot and 26.5-foot samples.  Maximum concentrations of TPHd, TPHg, and BTEX were reported at 10.1 mg\/kg, 11.4 mg\/kg and 0.046, 0.18, 1, and 4.2 mg\/kg, respectively, in the B-4 6-foot bgs sample.  Additionally, the concentration of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) was reported at 0.061 mg\/kg.   The B-5 8-foot sample was reported to contain concentrations of TPHd, TPHg, and BTEX of 269 mg\/kg, 285 mg\/kg 6.2, 21.6, 30.9, and 143 mg\/kg, respectively, and the B-5 26.5-foot sample was reported to contain concentrations of TPHd, TPHg, and BTEX of 346 mg\/kg, 338 mg\/kg, 16.2, 73.5, 52.8, and 255 mg\/kg, respectively, with MTBE at 0.02 mg\/kg.  The grab groundwater (GGW) sample from bore B-4 at 20 feet was reported to contain concentrations of TPHd, TPHg, and BTEX of 11,300 ug\/L, 11,300 ug\/L and 6,960 ug\/L, 8,310 ug\/L, 6,420 ug\/L, and 26,000 ug\/L, with MTBE at 241 ug\/L.  The B-5 GGW sample 20 feet was reported to contain concentrations of TPHd, TPHg, and BTEX of 20,400,000 ug\/L, 23,500,000 ug\/L and 324,000 ug\/L, 1,050,000 ug\/L, 918,000 ug\/L, and 4,120,000 ug\/L, with MTBE at non-detect (ND)&lt;50 ug\/L.  The B-5 GGW sample from 32 feet was reported to contain concentrations of TPHd, TPHg, and BTEX of 294,000 ug\/L, 422,000 ug\/L and 8,100 ug\/L, 20,200 ug\/L, 9,580 ug\/L, and 60,800 ug\/L, with MTBE at 632 ug\/L.      In June, 2010 monitoring wells, MW�-11, MW�-12, MW�-12A, and MW�-13, were installed.  The wells were installed to depths of 15 feet bgs (MW�-13), 20 feet bgs (MW�-11 and MW�-12), and 34 feet bgs (MW�-12A).  Analytical results from the soil samples collected from the borings for monitoring wells MW-12 and MW-12A indicated that the soil was impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons.  The MW-12 water sample was reported to contain concentrations of TPHd, TPHg, and BTEX of 990 ug\/L, 20,300 ug\/L, and 1,030 ug\/L, 955 ug\/L, 311 ug\/L, and 2,450 ug\/L, with MTBE at 1,650 ug\/L.  The MW-12A water sample was reported to contain concentrations of of TPHd and TPHg, and BTEX of 469 ug\/L and 122 ug\/L, and BTE at ND&lt;0.50 ug\/L, X at ND&lt;1.5 ug\/L, with MTBE at 217 ug\/L.  In May 2011, four on-site wells, MW�-14 through MW-17, were installed to monitor shallow groundwater.  Additionally, one soil boring, B-6, was advanced at the site.     Five borings (HPB-1 through HPB�-5) were advanced in March 2012 to obtain a hydraulic profile of the Sub-surface site soils.  In July 2013, ten soil borings (SB-1 through SB-�10) were advanced at the site to delineate petroleum hydrocarbon impacted soil around monitoring well MW-6.  In 2014, monitoring wells MW-10, MW-12, MW-12A, and MW-17 were destroyed and two cone penetration test (CPT) borings, CPT�-1 and CPT�-2, were performed in anticipation of excavating residual source material.  Data from the CPT bore were used to help design shoring for excavations.  Additionally, three off-site soil borings, SB-13 through SB-15 were advanced to delineate the contaminant plume.   The most elevated soil concentrations of TPH were reported in bore SB-13.  SB-13, advanced approximately 260 feet down gradient of the site along west side of Hegenberger, was reported to contain TPHd at 1,800 mg\/kg @ 8.5�ft, and 1,100 mg\/kg @ 20�ft.  BTEX concentrations for the all the SB-13 soil samples were ND&lt;0.0050 mg\/kg.  GGW concentrations of TPHd for SB�-13, SB�-14, and SB-15 were reported at 450 ug\/L, 480 ug\/L, and 280 ug\/L, respectively.  TPHg, and BEX concentrations were reported below the laboratory reporting limit and T was detected in one GGW, SB-15, at 5.9 ug\/L.    In March 2015, a sensitive receptor survey update was conducted for the site consisting of a review of DWR and Alameda County Public Works Agency (ACPWA) records. Three irrigation wells with verifiable locations were found in a review of DWR records (980 feet south�-southeast, 1,700 feet south-southeast, and 2,570 feet south�-southeast of the site).  Five additional wells were identified whose location could not be determined which may be water supply wells.  A web�-based receptor search and a site reconnaissance were also conducted.   In July 2015, on�-site monitoring wells MW�-6 and MW�-14 were destroyed in preparation for on-site soil excavation activities. Additionally two off-site soil borings (SB�-11 and SB�-12) were advanced to aid in the delineation of the down gradient contaminant plume.  Concentrations of TPHg TPHd with SGC, &amp; BTEX &amp; MTBE were reported below laboratory detection limits for soil and grab-groundwater samples.  On October 18, 2017 an additional down gradient soil bore, SB-19, was advanced for contaminant plume delineation.  TPHg, and BTEXM concentrations were reported below laboratory detection limits for soil; grab-groundwater  was reported to contain TPHg at a concentration of 58 ug\/L with BTEXM compounds reported below laboratory detection limits.  TPHd was not an analyte for either soil or GGW samples.           On April 27, 2016, ACEH received notification of the commencement of excavation activities associate with the removal of residual source material.  Excavation activities occurred in four Area, designated E1 through E4, completed by July 25, 2016.  A total of 1,559.85 tons of soil excavated and transported for off-site disposal.  Though the destroyed network wells were proposed to be replaced, following data review and monitoring of the few remaining network wells, ACDEH has concluded the site is eligible for closure consideration.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site investigation activities have identified two environmental concerns for the site:    • Fuel leaks from two former underground storage tanks (USTs) located in the southern portion of the site.  Prior to 1989, the Malibu Grand Prix facility maintained two 6,000-gallon underground storage tanks (USTs) containing marine mix gasoline.  The two USTs were removed on March 29, 1989 and February 1, 1990, respectively.  Free-phase fuel was observed floating on water in the tank excavations during both tank removals.  During the tank removal on March 29, 1989, soil samples collected from the tank excavation contained benzene at concentrations ranging from 7.3 to 33 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) and total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) at concentrations ranging from 50 to 150 mg\/kg.  During the tank removal on February 1, 1990, soil samples collected from the tank excavation contained benzene at concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 0.31 mg\/kg and TPHg at concentrations ranging from 26 to 79 mg\/kg.  Subsequent site investigations from 1990 to 1996 that included soil and groundwater sampling detected fuel hydrocarbons and oxygenates in soil and groundwater over a wide area beneath the site.  Benzene and TPHg were detected in groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells at the site at concentrations up to 2,700 and 20,000 micrograms per liter (µg\/L), respectively.      • Imported fill material that contains a tar-like substance.  The fill material is present throughout the site and appears to have been placed on the site between 1955 and 1975.  Known chemicals of concern in the imported fill include polychlorinated biphenyls, phenanthrene, naphthalene, pyrene, and lead.    ACDEH has requested but not received additional information to evaluate these environmental concerns.    A separate Site Cleanup Program Case is associated with the non-leaking underground storage tank contaminants.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This case is for the one 500-gallon fuel UST located along the west side of Linden Street near West Grand Avenue of the EBMUD facility.  The tank was removed in June 1987.  Sampling following tank removal revealed total fuel hydrocarbon concentrations of 170 mg\/kg and BTX concentrations of 3.6 mg\/kg, 15 mg\/kg and 11 mg\/kg, respectively, indication a release had occurred, resulting in the opening of this case in August 1988.       The tank pit was over excavated July of 1987.  Sampling following over-excavation revealed total fuel hydrocarbon concentrations of 140 mg\/kg and BTX concentrations of 1.2 mg\/kg, 0.5 mg\/kg and 1.9 mg\/kg, respectively. The former pit was deepened to 12 feet in April 1988 with confirmation sampling revealing total fuel hydrocarbon concentrations reported as ND&lt;10 mg\/kg.  the BTEX analyses were lost and not reported.  Two bores were advanced in 2018 to assess the residual TPH concentration in the vicinity of the former UST and to include MTBE in the scope of analysis for GGW samples.  Soil concentrations for TPHg and TPHd were reported at up to 270 mg\/kg and 140 mg.\/kg, respectively and BTEX and naphthalene compounds were report at concentrations below their respective laboratory reporting limit.  GGW concentrations for TPHg, TPHd and naphthalene were reported at up to 2,700 ug\/L, 2,300 ug\/L and 0.60 ug\/L, respectively, and BTEX compounds were report at concentrations below their respective laboratory reporting limit.    Based on the elevated TPH concentrations in groundwater, a sensitive receptor survey was performed prior to determining if additional groundwater characterization needs to be performed.  The case was deemed eligible for closure on 5-26-2020.      .",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "An underground storage tank was discovered beneath the sidewalk at 645 Fourth Street in Oakland in 2006.  Due to the proximity to the building, the tank was closed in place by filling with a concrete slurry on September 5, 2006.  Prior to filling the tank with concrete slurry, soil samples were collected beneath the tank.  Fuel hydrocarbons were detected in the soil samples.  Soil borings have been advanced in the area of the tanks to investigate the extent of contamination.  Interim remediation using high-vacuum dual-phase extraction (HVDPE) was conducted in 2010 and 2012.  Confirmation soil, sub-slab soil vapor, and groundwater sampling conducted in 2013 through 2015 indicate that the HVDPE was effective in a limited area in the immediate vicinity of the historic UST. Petroleum hydrocarbons were reported in soil, and groundwater beneath the existing buildings 645 and 647 4th Street, and 638 3rd Street. Total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline, benzene, ethylbenzene and xylenes have been reported in soil vapor samples at 645 and 647 4th Street.  Indoor air sampling has been conducted at 645 4th Street, 380 Martin Luther King, Jr. Way, and 638 3rd Street on December 5, 2015. Two outdoor air samples were also collected on December 5, 2015 for comparison purposes. Benzene was detected in the indoor air samples at concentrations ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 micrograms per cubic meter and was detected in the outdoor air samples at concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 1.2 micrograms per cubic meter. As of March 2022, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has requested the preparation and submittal of a feasibility study evaluating cleanup technologies for removal of petroleum impacted soil (secondary source) to the maximum extent practicable to achieve cleanup that will meet the State Water Resources Control Board's low threat underground storage tank case closure policy (LTCP) criteria including reduction of secondary source to the maximum extent practicable, reduction of petroleum vapor intrusion to indoor air and create conditions that will meet water quality objectives within a reasonable timeframe for groundwater in accordance with the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board’s January 18, 2007, Water Quality Control Plan (Basin Plan).",

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at https:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Overland diesel releases at the site were observed in February 1991. These releases entered the the adjacent estuary.  An SWI conducted revealed the presence of TPH to 13,000 mg\/kg.  Eight GW wells were installed in Aprill 1991, with free product observed in two of the wells up to 4.22 feet thick.  Three recovery wells were installed in June 1991.   In May 1993, a 12,000 gallon waste oil UST was removed from the site.  Soil staining, TPHg, TPHd and TOG in soil were reported to contain upto 1,300 mg\/kg, 21,000 mg\/kg and 25,000 mg\/kg, respectively, and assorted SVOCs (including naphthalene to 20 mg\/kg, phenanthrene to 30 mg\/kg, and 92 including 2-methylnaphthalene).   In October 1995, an approximately 750-gallon diesel spill occurred at the site.      A pump and treat system for FP removal began operation on May 8, 1992 and operated at least through November 30, 1999, having treated 7,348,990 gallons of water and removed 11,200 gallons of free product.  The system was removed for port redevelopment and all MWs were decommissioned in 2001 due to the pending redevelopment. The SF Regional Board assumed case lead during the redevelopment project. A replacement pump and treat system was installed and began operation in December 31, 2003 and operated until July 2005, having treated 249,685 gallons of water and removed an additional 2,300 gallons of free product.   Though SFRB is documented to have transferred the case back to ACDEH in 2006, the SFRB retained control of the case until early 2019.      ACDEH is currently reviewing the mass-upload of documents submitted in May 2019.",

The site originally consisted of two project areas referred to as the \"West Grand Block\" and the \"Market Street Blcik\". The West Grand Block consists of a full city block bounded by Filbert\/ Myrtle\/ 24th St\/ and W. Grand and includes two parcels identified as Assessor Parcel Numbers (APNs) 5-430-130 and 5-430-157. The \"Market Street Block\" consists of a central block section located between Myrtle St. and Market St and includes 5 parcesl identified as APN s xxxx.   In 2019, ACDEH opened a separate Site Cleanup Case (RO0003379) for the Market Street Block project area to facilitate phased redevelopment of the two projects by City Ventures.     Environmental investigations and remedial actions have been conducted on both the West Grand Block and Market Street Block to investigate and cleanup subsurface contamination related to historic land on the parcels to facilitate redevelopment. The West Grand Block is being redeveloped as the \"Ice House Condominiums\" consisting of 15 mixed use (residential and commercial), multi-story buildings with slab-on-grade construction. Vapor mitigation engineering controls (VMECs) are required to be installed at the Ice House Condominiums Redevelopment site in areas where elevated levels of volatile organic compounds remain in the subsurface at levels that pose a potential vapor intrusion risk to indoor air in the buildings. VMECs include installation of trench dams to control vapor migration along utility corridors  and vapor mitigation systems (VMS) beneath Building No.'s 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11. On December 23, 2019, ACDEH approved the VMS for Building No.'s 6 &amp; 10 provided clearance for occupancy. On March 25, 2020, ACDEH approved the VMS for Building No. 5 vapor and provided clearance for occupancy.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently an open landscaped area with no structures that is located on the south corner of the intersection of foothill Boulevard and 106th Avenue in Oakland, CA.  Adjacent land use includes a shopping center and residential homes.  .    The property was used as a gasoline service station between 1958 and 1982.  According to 1964 site plans from the City of Oakland Building Department, three underground storage tanks (USTs) were present in the southwestern corner of the property and two dispenser islands were located on the northern side of the property.   The USTs were reportedly removed between October 20, 1981 and June 15, 1982.  However, no tank removal report or other records exist to document the removal.    Soil type is relatively uniform throughout the site and consists of clay and clayey silt to approximately 18 feet below ground surface (fbgs) over a layer of silt and sandy silt between approximately 18 and 22 fbgs.      On March 19, 2004, four soil borings (SB-1 through SB-4) were advanced in the area of the former USTs and dispenser islands to depths ranging between 8 to 22 fbgs.  Four soil and two grab groundwater samples were collected from the borings.  The two soil samples collected from the former dispenser area (SB-3 and SB-4) did not contain Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), or benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, or xylenes (BTEX) at concentrations above the reporting limit, with the exception of one detection of 2.1 parts per million (ppm) TPHd.  The two soil samples collected from the area of the former USTs contained 1,000 ppm TPHg, 590 ppm TPHd, 0.55 ppm benzene, 11 ppm toluene, 0.92 ppm ethylbenzene, and 2.6 ppm xylenes.  The two groundwater samples were both collected from the former UST area and contained up to 3,200 parts per billion (ppb) TPHg, 4,200 ppb TPHd, 250 ppb benzene, and 71 ppb xylenes.    On May 26 and 27, 2005, nine soil borings (SB-5 through SB-13) were advanced throughout the site, surrounding the former UST and dispenser areas.  At least three soil samples were collected from each boring at depths ranging between 5 and 25 fbgs.  One groundwater sample was collected from each boring.  The deeper soil samples, collected between 24.5 and 25 fbgs contained the greatest contaminant concentrations.  The soil sample collected from boring SB-9, located near the northeastern boundary of the property, at 24.5 fbgs contained TPHg at a maximum concentration of 279 ppm.  The grab groundwater samples collected at 20 fbgs and south of the former UST area contained up to 2,250 ppb TPHg and 701 ppb TPHd.  The highest concentration of TPHd was 801 ppm, detected in the SB-8 grab groundwater sample located within the former dispenser area.    Between May 1, 2006 and May 3, 2006, seventeen soil borings (SB14 through SB21 and V1 through V10) were advanced for the collection of soil vapor, soil, and groundwater samples.  At least four soil samples and one groundwater sample were collected from individual borings SB14 through SB21. Soil vapor samples were collected in wells V1 through V10 in addition to seven total soil samples from shallow vapor wells V3, V4, V5, and V8.  Results of the soil and groundwater sampling indicate that a majority of the soil contamination is contained between 15 and 20 fbgs within and west of the former UST area.  The greatest TPHg and benzene soil vapor samples were collected from VP10, located near the former UST area, at concentrations up to 17,000,000 micrograms per cubic meter (µg\/m3) and 1,900 µg\/m3, respectively.      Four groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-3, and MW-5) and five soil vapor monitoring wells were installed between January 22 and 24, 2007.  Soil samples were collected from groundwater monitoring well borings at two foot intervals between depths of 6 and 26.5 fbgs.    One soil sample was collected from each vapor monitoring well at 5.5 fbgs.  The greatest soil contamination wasdetected approximately 20 feet northeast of the former USTs in the MW-2 boring at a depth of 26 fbgs, which contained 964 ppm TPHg, 10.6 ppm TPHd, and 44 ppm benzene.      Soil vapor monitoring wells VW6 through VW12 were installed on March 23, 2009 and sampled on March 27, 2009.  Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) for residential land use were exceeded for either TPHg or benzene in soil vapor from wells VW2 and VW7 through VW12.  The maximum concentrations in soil vapor were 4,400,000 µg\/m3 TPHg, 150 µg\/m3 benzene, 1,700 µg\/m3 toluene, and 5,300 µg\/m3 1,1-Diflouroethane (1,1-DFA).    On February 16 through 19 and 26, 2010, five 20-foot deep, connected slots were excavated over an area that encompassed the former USTs.  A pre-excavation soil investigation (borings PB1 through PB4) took place on January 26, 2010 to define the areas with residual contamination and evaluate the geotechnical stability of the soil.  Confirmation soil samples were collected from the outer sidewalls of each slot at a depth of 15 fbgs.  The greatest detections in the confirmation soil samples were 1,300 ppm TPHg and 200 ppm TPHd, which were collected from the eastern sidewall of the excavation.  Due to these elevated concentrations, the eastern sidewall was extended several feet and sampled.  Soil samples collected from the extended eastern excavation did not contained TPHg or TPHd at concentrations above the reporting limit.      Soil vapor sampling was conducted in all remaining vapor monitoring wells on October 12, 2010 to examine the potential for vapor intrusion at the site.  Four wells were not sampled due to either water in the wells or low-flow conditions.  Well VW2, which is near the western property boundary, contained TPHg at a concentration of 190,000 µg\/m3 but did not contain benzene at a concentration above the reporting limit of 8.2 µg\/m3.  The western property boundary is bordered by residential properties.    On January 19, 2011, another round of soil vapor monitoring was conducted in wells VW2 and VW11 to provide additional information on soil vapor near the western property boundary and in the area of the former dispensers.  Attempts were made to sample wells VW3 and VW4, but were unsuccessful due to water in the wells.  Soil vapor from well VW2 contained concentrations below 9,900 µg\/m3 TPHg.  The soil vapor sample from well VW11, located within the former dispenser area, contained 420,000 µg\/m3 TPHg.    Four vapor monitoring wells in the northern portion of the site were sampled on October 11, 2011.  All other vapor monitoring wells were not sampled due to perched groundwater in the wells.  The maximum concentration of TPHg in soil vapor 110,000 µg\/m3 in soil vapor monitoring well VW-5, which is near the former USTs.    Due to persistent perched water in several vapor monitoring wells, four replacement wells (VW3R, VW4R, VW11R, and VW12R) were installed.  Soil vapor sampling occurred on December 29 and 30, 2011.  Soil vapor collected along the western property boundary adjacent to a residential property, contained 330 µg\/m3 TPHg and 8.3 µg\/m3 benzene.  Soil vapor collected from VW-11 near the dispenser area contained 220,000 µg\/m3 TPHg but benzene was not present above the reporting limit.  TPHg soil vapor concentrations along the adjacent residential boundary have shown a decreasing trend over the past five years, during which time oxygen concentrations have increased and constituent concentrations have decreased.      Groundwater monitoring was conducted quarterly from March 2007 to December 2008, then semi-annually up to March 2010.  Groundwater concentrations have decreased since 2007.  During the most recent groundwater sampling event in March 2010, the maximum concentration of TPHg and MTBE were 520 and 0.72 ppb, respectively.  Benzene was not present in groundwater at concentrations above the reporting limit during the most recent groundwater monitoring event.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Current Land-use at time of Closure-  The site is located in a Union Pacific Railroad (UP) intermodal rail yard consisting of multiple rail spurs and sidings in addition to multiple main lines. This case was opened in response to an unauthorized release of diesel fuel from a ruptured locomotive fuel tank along Track 58 on March 26, 2015, releasing approximately 4,000 gallons of diesel fuel.   Though land ownership is identified as Southern Pacific (SP Co) in Attachment 4, Southern Pacific merged with UP on September 11, 1996.      Due to residual contamination, the site was closed with site management requirements that include notifying Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) of a proposed change in land use to any residential or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment or building alteration is proposed that affect or disturb the existing subsurface conditions at the site.    Adjacent Property(ies) Land-use at Time of Closure-  The site is bounded on the north by Interstate Highway 880 (I-880) and the west by Port of Oakland shipping facilities.  Additional UP facilities are located to the south and east.    Historic Land-use \/ Site Investigation-  The site has been the location of UP rail facilities since at least the 1870s.  At the time of the release the site was developed as a rail yard.  The release occurred on Track 58, approximately 250 feet south-southwest of I-880.    Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern-  Approximately 4,000 gallons of red dye diesel fuel was released at the site as a result of the locomotive fuel tank rupture.  Total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd and naphthalene are chemicals of concern.  Potential exposure routes are direct contact and inhalation.  Based on the remedial actions described below, the release was contained and the fuel recovered.      Remediation Activities-   Approximately 4,000 gallons of diesel fuel was released as a result of the tank rupture.  Emergency response activities, initiated on March 26, 2015, consisted of the excavation of extraction trenches.  As of March 28, 2015, 1,200 gallons of diesel were recovered.  Following the emergency response, sections of track were removed along three of the rail lines and soil was excavated between April 7 and April 20, 2015 to a depth of approximately five (5) feet- the depth to first water.  Approximately 1,570 tons of soil was removed and disposed off-site.  A grab-groundwater sample collected from the excavation indicated the release resulted in minimal impacts to groundwater.      Case Closure &amp; Future Site Management Requirements-    Although not an underground storage tank, this fuel release case has been evaluated for closure using the criteria contained in the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  Although the site does not meet the LTCP Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air and Direct Contact Media Specific Criteria, the site is considered a low risk due to its location and land use.     Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial rail yard with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is an active Shell-branded service station that is bordered to the northwest by an on-ramp to I-580, to the southwest by Golf Links Road, to the southeast by Mountain Boulevard, and to the northeast by a former service station.  Surrounding land use is mixed commercial and residential.  This case closure addresses releases of gasoline detected during dispenser upgrade activities in 1998.  A previous release from a former waste oil tank was evaluated under ACEH case RO0002889, which was closed on June 18, 1996.      Previous Case RO2889    On March 7, 1995, a 550 gallon, single walled, steel waste oil UST was removed.  Soil samples collected from the bottom of the excavation at a depth of 7 feet below ground surface (bgs) contained up to 12,000 ppm total oil and grease (TOG), 190 ppm total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and 3,900 ppm total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd).  After over excavation, confirmation soil samples from a depth of 11 feet bgs contained up to 62 ppm TOG and TPHg and TPHd were not detected.  On December 15, 1995, one soil boring (B 1) was advanced to a depth of 48 feet bgs in the vicinity of the former waste oil UST.  Soil samples from the boring contained up to 2.8 ppm TPHd at 30.5 feet bgs and 56 ppm TOG at 40.5 feet bgs.  Groundwater was not encountered in the soil boring.  Case RO0002889, which addressed the release from the waste oil tank was closed on June 18, 1996.    Current Case RO2441    Soil samples collected beneath one dispenser (D 4) at a depth of 4 feet bgs during station upgrade activities on February 4, 1998, contained up to 7,800 ppm TPHg and 37 ppm benzene.  Because no field indications of hydrocarbons were observed, no soil samples were collected beneath the other dispensers.   On July 6 and 31, 1998, one soil boring (SB 1) was installed to a depth of 30 feet bgs in the vicinity of dispenser sample D 4.  Up to 14,000 ppm TPHg, 100 ppm benzene, and 23 ppm methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) were reported in soil samples from boring SB-1.  No groundwater samples were collected.    On August 25, 1999, five soil borings (SB 1b and SB 2 though SB 5) were advanced to depths ranging from 16 to 30 feet bgs.  Up to 243 ppm TPHg and 2.23 ppm MTBE were detected in soil samples from the boring.  No benzene was reported in any of the soil samples analyzed.  Grab water samples collected from borings SB 2 and SB 3 contained up to 256 ppb TPHg, 2.42 ppb benzene, and 11,800 ppb MTBE.    During upgrades of the dispensers and piping at this site in April 2004, eight soil samples were collected from depths between 4.5 to 5 feet bgs.  Up to 3,200 ppm TPHg and 0.060 ppm MTBE were detected in soil.  On June 14, 2004 one pilot soil boring (PH 1) was advanced to a depth of 68.5 feet bgs in the vicinity of northwestern dispenser sample D 3.  No TPHg, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, or MTBE were detected in the soil samples collected from boring PH 1.    In January and February, 2005, four groundwater monitoring wells (S 1, S 2, S 4, and S 5) were installed at the site.  TPHg was reported in two soil samples at a maximum concentration of 21 ppm.  Benzene was not detected in any soil samples.  MTBE was reported in six of the 15 soil samples, at a maximum concentration of 0.63 ppm.  All of the soil samples with reportable concentrations of constituents of concern were collected below groundwater.    The Arroyo Viejo Creek is located both above ground and below ground in culverts in the area of the site.  From south to southeast of the site, the Arroyo Viejo Creek is aboveground and flowing to the west.  It flows underground at a culvert inlet approximately 80 feet southwest of the site, and flows beneath Golf Links Road.  Ultimately, the Arroyo Viejo Creek daylights again approximately 500 feet to the northwest, near Encina Avenue and Golf Links Road.  Quarterly groundwater monitoring began at the site in March 2005.  Depths to water have ranged from 4.86 to 11.49 feet below the top of well casings.  During the November 2009 sample event, well S 1 contained 520 ppb TPHg, 4.5 ppb MTBE, and 34 ppb TBA.  Well S 5 contained 230 ppb TPHg, 0.82 ppb benzene, 26 ppb MTBE, and 210 ppb TBA.  No constituents of concern were detected in wells S 2 and S 4.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This LUST Case (RO0001135) was originally opened by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) in 1992 as a Leaking Underground Fuel Tank (LUFT) case. The case was opened in response to a July 15, 1986 reported gas leak from an underground storage tank (UST) at the site. Southern Pacific Transportation Company was named as the Responsible Party. In 1996 Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) acquired Southern Pacific Railroad Transportation company and was named as an RP. In 2011 Leslie Bacon, et al c\/o Economy Lumber was added as an RP as property owner (purchase property in 1998).    Based on a review of data presented in the Soil and Groundwater Investigation and Updated Site Conceptual Model dated May 8, 2015 and the Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) dated July 2, 2015, ACDEH determined that the chemicals of potential concern (CPOCs), sources and release mechanisms documented in these reports can not be attributed to a UST petroleum release, and therefore administratively closed LUFT Case No. RO0001135 and opened Cleanup Program Site Case No. RO0003309 and entered into a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement with Union Pacific Railroad Company on October 23, 2018.     Site History:    The site consists of one parcel, with an area of 1.86 acres (Alameda County Assessor's Parcel Number 34-2293-6-7). The site was previously part of a larger Southern Pacific Transportation Company holding located along the railway corridor before purchased by Economy Lumber in November 1990. In August 2015, ACDEH approved a work plan for interim remedial measures presented in a report entitled Addendum to the Revised Surface Improvement  Plan Work Plan. Proposed measures include soil cement surface treatment and asphalt paving in an approximate 0.35 acre unpaved area within the southern portion of the site to limit potential worker exposure to CPOCs in shallow soil and create a surface to allow for the existing lumber yard related operations to continue at the site.  An Interim Remedial Report was due on November 16, 2015. As of June 28, 2017 the report has not been submitted. The latest correspondence dated June 9, 2016 indicates that UPRR and Economy Lumber were negotiating access permission and operations and maintenance responsibilities and that there was no timetable for implementation of the surface improvement at the site.    The site has been used for industrial purposes by known and unknown occupants since the 1910s. The documented uses of the property since that time include scrap metal salvage, sheet metal and welding fabrication and auto body repair in the northern and central portions of the site. Scrap Metal Supply (SMS) operated a scrap metal salvage business at the site for approximately 36 years that included a former UST probably containing diesel fuel. No information concerning SMS's day to day operations is present in the historical documents reviewed however given the distribution and occurrence of chemicals, historical site layout, and an analogous business at he adjacent property, sources and release mechanisms can be inferred but are not know with certainty. The inference of possible sources and release mechanisms serves to help the understanding the distribution of chemicals of potential concern (CPOCs) at the site.     CPOCs for the site appear to be select PCBs, PAHs, TPH-d, TPH-mo and select metals which generally are detected in the upper six feet of soil and shallow groundwater in several areas throughout the site. The areas of greatest soil and groundwater impacts are concentrated near the former scale office and outbuildings, south of the main building at the railroad spur terminus and possible former UST location, and along the peripheries of the central and southern portion of the site.     The Learner Investment Company property located southeast of the site at 768 46th Avenue was operated as a scrap metal bailing yard form the 1960s to 1982. this offsite facility received scrap metal such as discarded appliances, industrial machinery, motors, empty drums and other scrap metal light enough to be hydraulically compressed. the occurrence and distribution of chemicals at the learner property are similar to those observed at the site. It has been hypothesized on the basis of results on investigations conducted at Learner Investment Company property and the site, that similar operations and subsequent release took place contemporaneously at SMS and the Learner Investment Company.    In addition to soil and groundwater impacts attributable to site activities and releases, fill material of unknown provenance deposited at the site also could have contributed to the presence of COPCs in shallow soil. Abundant metallic scrap and a vesicular, metallic rock like material with a burned appearance have been described in fill materials during subsurface investigations at the site. It is possible that such material is attributable in part to an explosion of the Western Fuse and Explosives Company located in 1898 located adjacent to the site and contributes to the concentrations of metals and other constituents in soil and groundwater samples. collected a the site.    The results of the HHRA, based on sampling data collected from 1988 through February 2015 and current exposure setting information, indicate that further action is required to address potential human exposure risk associated with CPOCs in surface (0 to 2 feet below ground surface) and total (0 to 10 feet bgs) in soil.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site is a two story 30-unit apartment building built in 1930.  A 1,500-gallon 'diesel' UST was removed from the sidewalk along Seminary Avenue on January 30, 2015.  The tank was observed to be in poor condition with visible holes.  No staining or odor was noted at the time of the UST removal.  Soil samples collected from beneath the tank were reported to contain up to 39.9 mg\/kg TPHd with BTEX and naphthalene concentrations documented below laboratory reporting limits. Two grab groundwater samples (9485-W and 9485-GW) were taken from the surface of the groundwater encountered in the UST excavation pit. These groundwater samples were analyzed for TPH-d, TPH as motor oil (TPH-mo), TPH-g, VOCs, naphthalene and PAHs.     The sample 9485-W taken on January 2015 showed that groundwater contained diesel fuel up to 12,800 ìg\/L.  The  TPH-d concentration from the groundwater resampling event showed a similar elevated concentration of 17,700 ìg\/L, TPH-g of 34.6   ìg\/L, the VOCs acetone, chloroform, naphthalene, p-isopropyl toluene and toluene at concentrations of 5.5 ìg\/L, 0.99 ìg\/L, 0.74  ìg\/L, 0.31 ìg\/L  and 10.7 ìg\/L , respectively, and a heavy range petroleum hydrocarbon (&gt;C28-C40) concentration of 1,670 ìg\/L. Concentrations of semi volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) the chrysene, fluorene, phenanthrene and pyrene were detected above their method detection limit, but below their reporting limits up to 0.65 ìg\/L, 2.2 ìg\/L, 3.8 ìg\/L and 0.81 ìg\/L, respectively.      A sensitive receptor survey conducted for a neighboring site located at 1970 Seminary Avenue in Oakland, approximately 440 feet northeast of the Site, was reviewed for water supply wells in the Department of Water Resources and Alameda County Public Works Agency’s (ACPWA) databases. The search was for a 2,000-foot radius and identified one water supply well installed at 2232 Seminary Avenue (approximately 1,000 feet north east of the Site) to a depth of 102 feet bgs for irrigation purposes.  The property owner was contacted and reported that he has no knowledge of wells located on his property.  Additionally, the State Water Board’s Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment (GAMA) program groundwater information system was used to search data sets for wells in the Department of Pesticide Regulation, Department of Water Resources, GAMA - Domestic Wells  and Public Water System Wells within 2,000 feet of the subject site.  No wells were identified with the search.      The nearest surface water, Seminary Creek, is located approximately 310 feet to the northwest of the site prior to entering an engineered storm channel.  Based on nearby flow directions, Seminary Creek is in the cross- to down gradient direction of the site.   The LTCP acknowledges that the vast majority of the TPH-d carbon range is higher than the the possible dissolved hydrocarbons (less than or equal to C14).  The TPH-d  carbon range for the analyses performed for this site encompassed C10-28.  Based on the low TPH-g concentration in pit water, the relative insolubility of the heavier range petroleum hydrocarbons and the distance to the creek,  ACDEH has made a determination that the residual petroleum hydrocarbon contamination evidenced at the UST pit does not present a significant risk to the creek.         No remediation other than the removal of the underground storage tank was conducted for this site as stockpiled soil from the excavation was returned to the tank pit following a review of the lab analysis report.    This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH determined that the site met all the LTCP General Criteria and Media Specific Criteria and therefore poses a low risk to human health and safety and the environment. The determination was based on receptors and environmental conditions identified at and in the vicinity of the site at the time of closure and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios.",

Free product was observed in well S-1.  In May 1990, three soil borings were advanced adjacent to the UST complex.  Soil samples indicated that TPHg was present in concentrations up to 7,500 mg\/kg.  In June 1990 two 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs, one waste-oil UST (variously reported having a capacity of  120-, 280-, and 550 gallons), were removed and replaced by 2 12,000-gal fuel and 1 550-gal waste oil tank.  Piping  and dispensers were also removed and replaced at the site.  Petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil.  Approximately 250 cu yds soil excavated and removed from site.      Groundwater wells were subsequently installed on-site and petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in groundwater. Free product was observed in wells U-1 and U-2 in the late 1990s, and was last observed in March 1998.  Free product skimmers operated in wells U-1 and U-2 in 1996 and 1997.  The 550-gal waste oil tank removed and product piping was removed and replaced in November 1996.  An additional 276 tons of soil was excavated and off-hauled at the time of the waste oil tank removal.      A tank cavity well was installed on 6\/24\/1997 and one on 9\/28\/2000.   A minimum of 36,700 gallons of contaminated groundwater was extracted via these wells and transported for off-site disposal. A 6-day DPE event was performed in April 1999.  Ozone sparging pilot test was performed June through August 2006   with post test monitoring.  Groundwater monitoring has been performed through May 2015.",

The USTs, a 250-gallon waste oil tank (WOT) and a 500-gallon fuel UST, were removed from the site in June 1991.  Visual observations of the removed USTs revealed the presence of numerous holes in both tanks.  Subsurface investigations followed revealing that free phase petroleum hydrocarbons are present in groundwater.   In 1994, an interim correction action was initiated.  However, free phase product is still present on and off site.  In June 1999 three groundwater monitoring wells were installed.  Free product was noted in  each of the wells at thicknesses of up to 10.6 feet.  Three additional monitoring wells were installed in 2001.  Soil vapor sampling was performed in 2009 revealing levels of soil gas below residential ESLs indicating vapor intrusion (VI) may be an incomplete pathway to indoor air.",

To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as automobile fueling and repair operations with associated former underground storage tanks, and printing shop.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil, soil vapor, and groundwater).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include remedial soil excavation and off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; extraction, treatment, and discharge of groundwater to the sanitary sewer; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes a eight story residential building with a subterranean garage and loading areas in the basement, commercial space, residential lobby, loading area and parking on the first floor, and residential condominium units on floors 2 through 7. The building will include 3 elevators (2 residential and 1 freight).  Proposed redevelopment plans include the over�]excavation of soils along the entire property to a depth of approximately 8 feet below ground surface to facilitate construction of the underground parking garage.        The Site is located at 229 and 255 International Boulevard at the northeast corner of the intersection of 3rd Avenue and International Boulevard.  The Site is currently a vacant lot developed with a single building, paved parking area, and an area with exposed dirt.  The Site consists of one parcel and is surrounded by residential and sparse commercial properties.  Currently redevelopment is proposed on the property and will include an eight story residential building with a subterranean garage and loading areas in the basement, commercial space, residential lobby, loading area and parking on the first floor, and residential condominium units on floors 2 through 7. The building will include 3 elevators (2 residential and 1 freight).  Proposed redevelopment plans include the over-excavation of soils along the entire property to a depth of approximately 8 feet below ground surface to facilitate construction of the underground parking garage.    Historical operations on the site included a commercial fueling facility, auto repair, and printing facility known to have handled hazardous materials in the past.    Qualitative results from a previous Phase II Investigation conducted in August 2017, indicated total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline (g) were reported in groundwater above San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board's Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) beneath the building located 255 International Blvd.      Subsequent investigation activities are being conducted to: 1) confirm the initial qualitative results presented in the Phase II investigation, 2) further assess the extent of onsite subsurface conditions in soil, soil gas, and groundwater, and 3) characterize in situ soils scheduled to be overexcavated during redevelopment for potential off-hauling and disposal.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site is a 5-story multi-family mixed-use residential complex on Jackson between 11th and 12th Streets.  The first floor of the building is commercial and on grade open ventilated parking with utility rooms and 2 elevators with retail suites along a portion of the Jefferson Street frontage.  Previously, the site was developed with the Oakland Hospital as early as 1889. Residential structures were located on-site in the early 1900s, with an automobile repair garage present from at least 1911 through 1933. By the 1940s\/1950s, a glass shop was present, as was a retail building and parking lots. By the 1960s\/1970s, a store and warehouse were present, as was a private school. In 2005, site development included a warehouse, beauty salon, market, and offices. All historic on-site structures reportedly were demolished in January 2007.  Construction of the current building was initiated in 2016.     Three underground storage tanks (USTs) used for the storage of gasoline were removed from beneath the sidewalk adjacent to the site along Jackson St. during utility trench work associated with site redevelopment.  The USTs, having capacities of 265 gallons, 265 gallons, and 110 gallons, were removed on April 15, 2016 and noted to be poor condition.  Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination was observed in the tank pit.  The laboratory analysis report for excavation samples included  total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) to 2,480 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) and naphthalene to 4.59 mg\/kg.  On May 4, 2016 a limited excavation of the tank pit was performed with confirmation sample concentrations of TPHg reported to 6,320 mg\/kg and benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes (BTEX) to 0.943 mg\/kg, 0.805 mg\/kg, 0.624 mg\/kg,and 3.05 mg\/kg, respectively, and naphthalene to 2.58 mg\/kg.   Additionally, several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) were reported at concentrations above their respective reporting limits.   A total of  78.20 tons soil manifested for off site disposal.  A fourth sidewalk UST, having a capacity of 750 gallons, reported to be used for the storage of diesel fuel, was discovered and removed from beneath the sidewalk adjacent to the site along Jackson St. in November 2016. The tank was reported in poor condition with visible holes.      In September 2016, a tank removal report was prepared documenting the activities associated with the April 2016 removal of 3 USTs.   Tank contents samples T1-TC, T2-TC and T3-TC were collected from each tank for profiling.  Addditionally, discrete soil stockpile samples, 9669-SP1-DISCRETE, 9669-SP2-DISCRETE and 9669-SP3-DISCRETE and an additional 4-point composite sample from the drummed soil (9669-DRUM-COMP) were also collected for disposal profiling.  Samples were analyzed for TPH-g, TPH-d, TPH-mo, TPH-k and VOCs.   Confirmation soil samples T1-C-9, T2-C-9, and T3-C9 (all having the 9699 prefix) were collected from the beneath each of the USTs.  The areas delineated by these samples were subsequently over excavated.  Confirmation soil samples (having the 9699 prefix) P1-4, P2-3.3 and P3-4, were recovered from the piping runs.      Over-excavation soil samples, also having the 9699 prefix, are bottom samples T1-C-12, T2-C-12.5 and T3-C-12 and sidewalls samples T1-NW-8, T1-EW-8, T1-WW-8, T2-SW-8, T2-EW-8, T2-WW-8, T3-NW-8, T3-SW-6.5, T3-EW-9 and T3-WW-8 were analyzed for TPH-g, TPH-d and TPH-mo, TPH-k, VOCs, SVOCs and the 5 LUFT metals.  TPH-g was detected at concentrations ranging from 78.8 to 6,320 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg).  TPH-d was non-detect for the eight (8) sidewall and 3 bottom samples.  TPH-mo concentrations were reported to range from non-detect to 135 mg\/kg in the 8 sidewall samples and non-detect for the 3 bottom samples.  TPH-k concentrations of up to  580 mg\/kg were reported.  Several VOCs were present, including benzene, butylbenzenes, ethyl benzene, propylbenzenes, p-isopropyltoluene, naphthalene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, toluene and xylenes; however, none of the detected VOC concentrations were reported to exceed their respective screening levels.  MTBE was not detected above laboratory limits in any soil samples collected.  Concentrations of the SVOCs acenaphthene , anthracene , benzo(a)anthracene , benzo(a)pyrene , benzo(b)fluoranthene , benzo(g,h,i)perylene, benzo(k)fluoranthene , chrysene , fluoranthene , fluorene, 1-methylnaphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene and pyrene were also reported.  Additionally, none of the detected metals concentrations exceeded their respective environmental screening levels.    On 11 August, 2016, four borings (EB-1 through EB-4) were advanced through the sidewalk to a maximum depth of 28 feet bgs to assess soil and groundwater conditions adjacent to the 3 USTs.  Only soil samples from the bore EB-2 were submitted for laboratory analysis.  Scope of the analysis was TPH-g, TPH-d and TPH-mo, VOCs and the 5 wear metals.  TPH-g, TPH-d and TPH-mo were detected in all three soil samples (EB-2-13, EB-2-15.5, and EB-2-22.5) with TPH-g reported at concentrations ranging from 200 to 5,000 mg\/kg.  TPH-d concentrations ranged from 18 to 830 mg\/kg and TPH-mo concentrations ranged from 5.5 to 14 mg\/kg.   The VOCs, ethylbenzene, xylenes, butyl-benzenes, propylbenzenes, trimethylbenzenes and naphthalene were detected at concentrations above the laboratory reporting limit in all three samples.  Benzene and MTBE were not detected above laboratory limits in any soil samples collected during this investigation.  Metals concentrations were reported within background levels.      Groundwater was encountered at depths ranging from 20 to 22 feet bgs.  EB-1-GW through EB-4-GW GGW sample concentrations for TPH-g and TPH-d  were reported at up to 30,000 ìg\/L and 55,000 ìg\/L, respectively.  Concentrations of VOCs, including acetone, benzene, 2-butanone, sec-butyl benzene, cis-1,2-dichloroethene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, isopropylbenzene, 4-isopropyl toluene, n-propyl benzene, trimethylbenzenes and xylenes, were also documented.   The maximum benzene concentration of 320 ìg\/L was detected in the EB-2 GGW sample.   In November 2016, a fourth UST was encountered during trenching for utility installation.  Holes and stained soil were evident at the time of its removal.  Two discrete soil samples, designated 9669-N-10’ and 9660-S-10’ were collected at a depth of 10 feet bgs from beneath each end of the tank.  The samples were analyzed for TPH-d, BTEX and naphthalene.  TPHd concentrations were reported at 1,400 mg\/kg and 2,800 mg\/kg, respectively, and naphthalene concentrations at 0.71 mg\/kg and 3.1 mg\/kg, respectively.   Xylenes were reported in one sample, 9660-S-10’ at 0.3 mg\/kg.  BTE compound concentrations were below their respective laboratory reporting limit.      In November 2016, an on-site investigation consisting of installation and sampling six (6) sub-slab (SS-1 through SS-6) sample points and five (5) soil gas wells (SG-1 through SG-5) for the collection of soil vapor and 4 bores (EB-5 through EB-8) for the recovery of soil and GGW samples.  Sub-slab sample point  SS-6 was added to the investigation following the discovery of the fourth UST.  The sub-slab and soil gas samples were analyzed for VOCs, methane, and the leak check gas helium.   Soil and GGW samples were analyzed for TPH-g, TPH-d, and TPH-mo;  VOCs and PAHs.  Soil samples were additionally analyzed for LUFT metals.    Of the six sub-slab vapor samples analyzed, a total of 12 VOCs, including acetone, benzene, 2-butanone or methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), carbon disulfide, cyclohexane, dichlorodifluoromethane (Freon 12), Freon 113, n-hexane, isopropanol, toluene, carbon disulfide, cyclohexane, dichlorodifluoromethane or Freon 12, Freon 113, n-hexane, isopropanol, and xylenes were detected.  None of the VOCs concentrations reported for any of the six sub-slab samples analyzed exceeded Of the five soil gas samples analyzed, a total of 11 VOCs, including acetone, benzene, 2-butanone or MEK, carbon disulfide, cyclohexane, dichlorodifluoromethane or Freon 12, ethylbenzene, n-hexane, toluene, trichlorofluoromethane, and xylenes were detected.  None of the VOCs detected in any of the five soil gas samples analyzed exceeded their respective Tier 1 ESLs, where established.  Two of the five soil gas samples, SG3-2016-11-17 and SG5-2016-11-17, had detectable concentrations of methane at 1.22 %v and 1.21 %v, respectively.    Soil samples were collected from depths of 4.5 and 8.5 feet bgs from each soil boring.   TPH-d was detected in one (EB-6-4.5) of the eight samples analyzed, at a concentration of 15 mg\/kg.  TPH-mo was detected in two of the eight samples analyzed, at concentrations of 160 mg\/kg (EB-6-4.5) and 5.1 mg\/kg (EB-8-4.5).  Naphthalene was the only VOC detected in the eight soil samples analyzed and was detected in a one sample, EB-6-4.5 at a concentration of 0.010 mg\/kg.  TPH-g was not detected at or above the laboratory reporting limit in any of the eight samples analyzed.  Concentrations of PAHs were detected in two (EB-6-4.5 and EB-8-4.5) of the eight soil samples analyzed, with BaPe concentrations more than an order of magnitude below the LTCP Direct Contact and Outdoor Air threshold values.  Four of the 5 LUFT metals were reported at concentrations within background levels.  However, lead in 2 soil samples (EB-6-4.5 and EB-8-4.5) were detected concentrations above background at 150 mg\/kg and 97 mg\/kg, respectively.  TPH-g was not detected in any of the 4 GGW samples analyzed. TPH-d was detected two of the four samples analyzed, at concentrations of 70 ìg\/L (EB-8-GW) and 290 ìg\/L (EB-6-GW). TPH-mo was detected in each of the four samples at concentrations ranging from 100 ìg\/L to 2,800 ìg\/L.  Concentrations of TBA and PCE were the only VOCs detected in the grab groundwater samples.  Acenaphthylene, reported in three of the 4 GGW samples, was the only PAH detected.   Acenaphthylene concentrations ranged from 0.133 ìg\/L to 0.607 ìg\/L.  In December 2016, the tank pit for the fourth UST was over-excavated and confirmation samples (all having the 9669 prefix) recovered.   Three bottom samples- C-14, C-17.5’ and C-18.5’, and four (4) sidewall samples (SW-9’, EW-9’, WW-8.5’ and NW-9’) were submitted for laboratory analysis for TPH-d, BTEX and naphthalene.   Samples C-17.5’ and C-18.5’ were also analyzed for PAHs.   Concentrations of TPH-d, ranging from 1,100 mg\/kg to 11,000 mg\/kg, were reported for the three bottom samples and ranged from 1.7 to 4,400 mg\/kg for the 4 sidewall samples.   Xylenes (1.2 mg\/kg) and naphthalene (6.9 mg\/kg) were reported for one bottom sample (C-14) and 2 sidewall samples, WW-8.5’ and NW-9’, at 0.53 and 1.2 mg\/kg and 6.4 and 16 mg\/kg, respectively.  Samples C-17.5’ and C-18.5’ were reported to contain the PNA compounds phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo (a) anthracene, benzo (a) pyrene, benzo (b) fluoranthene, benzo (k) fluoranthene and dibenzo (a,h) anthracene.    Additionally, sample C-17.5 contained detectable concentrations of  fluorene, chrysene, benzo (g,h,i) perylene and ideno (1,2,3-cd) pyrene.      An investigation conducted in January 2018 consisted of advancing five (5) soil bores (EB-9 through EB-13) for the collection of soil and GGW samples.  The borings were advanced to depths ranging from 27 to 38 feet bgs.  Groundwater was measured at depths ranging from 19 to 21 feet bgs.  In each boring, two soil samples were collected within the first five feet, and at five foot intervals thereafter (i.e. 10, 15, 20 feet bgs) until groundwater was encountered.  GGW samples were collected from four of the five borings at two discrete depths- shallow (first encountered water) and deep (10 feet below shallow water).    Soil and GGW samples were analyzed for TPH-g, TPH-d and TPH-mo and VOCs.  TPH-g was not detected above the laboratory reporting limit in the 34 soil samples analyzed; TPH-d was detected in two of 34 samples at concentrations of 1.6 and 1.9 mg\/kg; TPH-mo was detected in five of 34 samples at concentrations ranging from 6.8 to 23 mg\/kg; and VOCs were not detected above the laboratory reporting limit in any soil samples collected from EB-9 through EB-13.  GGW analysis results documented TPH-g concentrations below laboratory reporting limits in the 10 samples analyzed; TPH-d concentrations were detected in seven of 10 samples analyzed ranging from 67 to 250 ìg\/L; TPH-mo was detected in five of 10 samples at concentrations ranging from 340 to 580 ìg\/L; and the VOCs chloroform, cis-1,2-dichloroethene, TBA, PCE and TCE were also detected.    Remedial activities consisted of over-excavation of contaminated soil in conjunction with the removal of the four USTs.  Size of the excavations were limited to sidewalk areas due to the proximity of underground utilities and the site structure.  Approximately 78.8  tons of soil was disposed off-site with the removal of tanks 1, 2 and 3.  An additional 24.74 tons of soil was disposed off-site with the over-excavation activities associated with the removal of the fourth UST.      This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  ACDEH determined that the site met all the LTCP General Criteria and Media Specific Criteria and therefore poses a low risk to human health and safety and the environment. The determination was based on receptors and environmental conditions identified at and in the vicinity of the site at the time of closure and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios.   Elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons remain in the subsurface in the sidewalk area adjacent to the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Current Land-use at time of Case Closure:    The subject property (APN 28-951-12-1) is located at 3101 35th Avenue, at the northern corner of the intersection of 35th and School Street in the central portion of the City of Oakland.  The site consists of approximately 10,240 square feet of land and is currently vacant.  At the time of this case closure, the vacant site is slated for redevelopment.  Due to non-petroleum contamination identified at the site, additional site characterization and\/or cleanup is being overseen by Alameda County as a Site Cleanup Program (SCP) Case No. RO0003238, under a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement.  This LUFT case is closed to the current commercial land-use risk scenario, consisting of a commercial vacant parcel at the site.  Due to residual contamination, the site was closed with site management requirements that include notifying Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) of a proposed change in land use to any residential or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment or building alteration is proposed that affect or disturb the existing subsurface conditions at the site.    Adjacent Property(ies) Land-use at Time of Case Closure:    At the time of this case closure, potential off-site contamination is likely on School Street and may extend onto properties across School Street. However, should off-site redevelopment occur, ACDEH recommends evaluating the redevelopment site(s) for chemicals of concern identified on this site.       Historic Land-use \/ Site Investigation:    The site has historically operated as a gasoline service station from 1959, and possibly as early as 1929, until the early 1980s.  Prior site occupants included a blacksmith,  a retail store and a tire and grease shop.  In the early 1980’s, the site operated as an auto supply store and an auto detail shop. It appears that the underground storage tanks (USTs) associated with a former Texaco Station which operated at the site were previously located in the southern portion of the property.  The Texaco underground storage tank (USTs) were removed sometime prior to 1982.  As a result of a property transaction, a Phase I report and a geophysical survey was conducted in 2015.  Three USTs, two tanks for the storage of gasoline and one waste oil tank, were removed under permit.  Contamination was detected in soil samples collected at the site.  Later that year, a soil, water, and soil gas investigation was conducted.  Additional investigation was conducted in 2016 and it was determined that the petroleum hydrocarbon related contamination was eligible for closure under the State Water Resources Control Board’s (SWRCBs) Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (LTCP).  Non-petroleum relating contamination will require further evaluation under a separate case (RO0003238).    Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern:    USTs and fuel dispenser piping are believed to be the sources of the contamination discovered and cleaned up at the site.  The main chemicals of concern (COCs) associated with the gasoline and waste oil USTs and detected at the site were total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX), and naphthalene.  Inhalation and ingestion appear to have been the most likely potential routes of exposure to these COCs.  The non-petroleum related contaminant tetrachloroethene (PCE) was also detected at the site.    Remediation Activities:    Corrective action consisting of UST removals and excavation of the contaminated soil have been completed in 2015.  Confirmation soil sample analytical results indicated residual petroleum hydrocarbons remain in soil.  Subsequent investigation indicated residual petroleum hydrocarbons remain in groundwater.  Potential off-site contamination is likely on School Street and may extend onto properties across School Street    Case Closure &amp; Future Site Management Requirements:     This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP). The case does not meet the LTCP Vapor Specific Media scenarios as the TPH concentration in bioattenuation zone exceeds 100 mg\/kg and the laboratory reporting limit for naphthalene exceeds the threshold concentration for Scenario 4.  However, ACDEH has made the determination that there is low potential threat to human health and safety from vapor intrusion to indoor air due to the presence of residual petroleum hydrocarbons.  Additionally, vapor intrusion risk to future building occupants from residual chlorinated solvents is being evaluated under SCP Case No. RO0003238.      Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  As there is a proposed change in land use to mixed-use residential, ACDEH has been notified, as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2, and is the process of re-evaluating the site relative to the proposed redevelopment under case RO0003238.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Two 10,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed on June 18, 1998.  A gasoline odor and visible discoloration of soil was noted in the UST pit.  Maximum petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations of 1,100 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), 5.2 mg\/kg benzene, and 13 mg\/kg methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) were detected in initial soil samples collected from beneath the USTs.  Additionally, a groundwatersample was collected on July 15, 2015 from an adjacent down gradient monitoring well (MW-5) associated with ACEH case #RO0000271, GeoTracker Global ID T0600100538.  Concentrations reported in well MW-5 were reported to contain 8,800 micrograms per liter (ug\/L) TPHg, 2,200 ug\/L benzene, 850 ug\/L MTBE, and 6,700 ug\/L tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA).  The contamination in well MW-5 may be attributed to a release at the subject site.     ACDEH was provided a copy of the tank removal report on October 20, 2015 and a staff letter, issued on March 3, 2016, requesting an investigation work plan to delineate the release.  Soil vapor investigation authorized 1\/18\/2019.  Meeting held on February 19, 2019 to discuss data and case status.  Based on the discussion ACDEH concluded it was premature to perform the soil vapor study until the preferential pathways have been identified.   ACDEH will request a hold on the soil vapor study and proposed well installation until additional hydrogeologic data is collected.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "an asphalt batch plant operated on a small portion of southwestern part of the Site prior to Learner acquiring the property. The main portion of the asphalt batch plant was located on the northwestern part of the Westside Building Materials property. Learner purchased the Site in the 1960s and operated a scrap metal bailing yard until October 1982 when operations ceased. The yard received scrap metal materials such as old appliances, industrial machinery, motors, empty drums, and other scrap metal light enough to be hydraulically compressed. The scrap was loaded into a hydraulic bailer via an electric crane and compressed into bails. Prior to 1971, automobiles were also bailed at the Site. After bailing, the scrap metal was resold to steel mills. After the yard was closed in 1982, Learner ceased operations and no activity reportedly took place at the Site until January 1988. At that time, Learner intended to redevelop the Site into an office and warehouse complex. Learner began to disassemble and remove the bailer and associated equipment including a large hopper, electric crane, and a pump house that included an aboveground tank and piping containing hydraulic fluid for the bailer. A set of railroad tracks along the northeastern property boundary was also removed. During the removal of the railroad tracks and the disassembly of the bailing equipment in 1988, Dames &amp; Moore observed excavations and soil stockpiles at the Site. Two large piles of soil (reportedly 6 to 8 feet high) were located approximately 50 feet north of the former bailing area and were formed following removal of the railroad bed material. The piles consisted primarily of soil with some gravel, small wood pieces,  and metal scrap. Several other large piles (reportedly 8 to10 feet high) located south of the former bailer consisted of soil and metal scrap that accumulated from material from the former on-site operations. Another pile estimated to be approximately 12 feet high and 15 feet in diameter, comprised of metal cables with some piping and scrap metal, was observed in the area south of the former bailer. In July 1988, Dames &amp; Moore (environmental consultants) conducted investigation activities in three areas of concern: the former bailing area, the soil pile areas, and the narrow drive area (Figure 3). Chemicals detected at the property are discussed in the June 2008 Soil and Groundwater Investigation Report available on GeoTracker.    The Site is located just north of the San Leandro Bay inlet of San Francisco Bay, and is underlain by Bay Mud and fluvial deposits. According to Woodward-Clyde Consultants, the Bay Mud ranges in thickness from less than 1 foot to more than 120 feet and is characterized by its saturation with saltwater and its low permeability. The groundwater quality has been described as brackish and of no practical use. Based on the lithologic data collected from the soil borings drilled at the Site in April 2008, the upper 12 feet of soil beneath the Site consists of interbedded layers of gravel, sand,  silt, and clay. Based on previous investigations on neighboring properties, depth to groundwater in the site vicinity is 7 to 8 feet bgs, and the groundwater flow direction reported by PG&amp;E (located southwest of the Site) is to the southwest.    The future redevelopment plan for this property is not known. However, it appears that the Site has been adequately characterized, concerning soil and groundwater quality, to allow for the planning of the future redevelopment of the Site. Based on the presence and magnitude of certain chemicals in soil and groundwater at the Site, various remedial alternatives, with confirmation sampling, may be required for certain commercial-industrial uses. Likely, the redevelopment of the Site will include the removal of PCB- and metals-affected soil that would be disturbed during redevelopment activities.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is located at 1112 29th Avenue, Oakland in a commercial and industrial area, and is currently used by Caltrans as vehicle storage and maintenance station.     Lithology beneath the site consists of sand and gravel fill below and asphalt concrete pavement from the ground surface to depths ranging from three to five feet below ground surface (bgs).  Underlying the fill material are fine grain soils consisting primarily of inter-bedded clayey sands and silts, and clays to a depth of approximately 25 feet bgs.    One 4,000-gallon UST and one 2,000-gallon UST were removed from the site on March 11, 1997.  Associated piping and fuel dispensers were also removed at that time.  Eight soil samples were collected from the tank pit excavation and soil stockpile, and approximately 52 tons of soil was removed and disposed of off-site.  Analysis soil samples collected from the tank pit indicated that an unauthorized release had occurred, and concentrations of up to 380 ppm TPHg, 1.65 ppm Benzene, 11.86 ppm Toluene, 8.04 ppm Ethylbenzene, 48.86 ppm Xylenes, and 9.15 ppm MTBE were detected in soil.    On April 6 and 7, 1999, soil and grab groundwater samples were collected from six soil borings (B-1 through B-6) installed at the site. Soil sampling data detected TPHg and MTBE at maximum levels of up to 13 ppm and 0.16 ppm in soil, respectively. Groundwater data collected during the investigation detected up to 520 µg\/L TPHg and 6,600 µg\/L MtBE. On August 13, 1999, soil and groundwater samples were collected from three additional borings (B-7 through B-9) were installed along the property boundary.  MTBE, Benzene and TPHg were detected in groundwater samples at concentrations of up to 3,800 µg\/L, 220 µg\/L and 5,600 µg\/L, respectively, while TPHg and MTBE were detected in soil samples at concentrations of up to 0.54 ppm and 0.011 ppm, respectively.      Four groundwater monitoring wells (MW1 through MW4) were installed on June 8, 2000 and a program of groundwater monitoring and sampling was implemented after well installation.  Soil samples collected during the well installation detected TPHd and MTBE to the south of the former USTs at concentrations of up to 23 ppm and 0.52 ppm, respectively.  MTBE was detected in all groundwater samples and was reported highest south of the former USTs (MW-3).  TPHg, VOCs, and BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes) were detected directly north and south of former USTs in the groundwater.     On August 24, 2001 three soil borings (B-10 through B-12) were installed offsite to define the lateral extent of contamination downgradient of the site. TPHg, BTEX and MTBE were not detected in soil above laboratory reporting limits. Groundwater samples detected maximum concentrations of up to 2.1 µg\/L MTBE southwest of the site, while TPHg and BTEX were not detected above laboratory reporting limits.    Groundwater monitoring has been conducted at the site from June 2000 to May of 2005. Groundwater gradient has typically been toward the southwest, with groundwater elevations between 8 feet to 10 feet below ground surface. The most recent groundwater data collected in May 2005 detected elevated levels of up to 1,300 µg\/L TPHg, 40 µg\/L benzene 3,200 µg\/L MTBE and 890 µg\/L TBA.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "A release of petroleum hydrocarbons was detected at the site in the area of former underground storage tank (UST).  The residual contamination appears to be weathered fuel oil.  The fuel source for the site changed from fuel oil to natural gas in the early 1970s; therefore, the fuel system has not been used for more than 30 years.  The UST was not located by borings in the suspected location of the UST and is presumed to have been removed.  However, no records of UST removal have been found.      Petroleum hydrocarbons were observed in soil borings from depths of approximately 11 feet bgs to depths of as much as 25 feet bgs.  The petroleum hydrocarbons were described as visible product in several soil borings advanced at the site.  The product appears to be immobile and did not accumulate in product recovery wells that were installed in areas of the site where visible product was observed.  The residual contamination extends from the area of the former fuel oil UST downgradient beneath East 11th Street and likely further south beyond East 11th Street.  Based on the depth, immobility, and type of petroleum hydrocarbons, the potential for exposure is low and the contamination does not appear to pose a risk unless exposed by excavation.  The site has been evaluated and appears to meet the criteria for case closure in the State Water Resources Control Board Low-threat Closure Policy.  Based upon the information available in our files to date, no further investigation or cleanup for the fuel leak case is necessary at this time.      Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This case was originally opened by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) as a Site Cleanup Case however was later converted to a LUST Case as the subsurface contamination is related to an unauthorized release of petroleum hydrocarbons from underground storage tanks (USTs).     Current Status: A work plan to delineate soil, soil vapor and groundwater impacts has been submitted to ACDEH for review.    History: The Site is located in a mixed-use industrial\/commercial and residential area of the Columbia Gardens neighborhood of Oakland. The subject site consists of four adjacent parcels totaling approximately 7-acres with associated Assessor Parcel Numbers (APNs) 44-5020-03-72, 44-5020-10, 44-5020-13 and 44-5020-14. The Property is located on the eastern corner of 98th Avenue and Bigge Street. The Site is bound to the northwest by 98th Avenue and further by an operating Chevron gasoline station and several restaurants.  The Site is bound to the northeast was a concrete lined drainage channel and single-family residences; to the southeast was Bigge Crane at 10000 Bigge Street, and to the southwest by Bigge Street.  Across Biggie Street are several automotive related rental and repair facilities.     The Site contains five building structures and currently operates as a Enterprise vehicle rental business.  A small vacant office building is located in the western corner of the Site.  A larger operating office building and repair and maintenance building that contains two large wash bays is located along the northwest 98th Avenue end of the Property.  A trench in the floor used for repair work and a storage area for cleaning chemicals were observed inside the maintenance building.  A large canopy structure behind the maintenance building with covered a parking area was also observed at the Site.  A warehouse was observed near the southeast end of the Site with approximately ½ the warehouse building was divided for four inflatable painting booths.       The Site was vacant and undeveloped from approximately 1899 through approximately 1953 when the Site was developed for a trucking facility (Morris Drayage).  Historical operations on all four parcels included numerous commercial operations including a roofing business, crane facility, and various rental vehicle business. Hsitroical information presented in the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment indicated three underground storage tanks (USTs) (1,000-gallon lubricating oil, 1,000-gallon waste oil and 10,000-gallon diesel) and a pump island were located in the vicinity of the maintenance building near the northwest end of the Property.  An 8,000-gallon gasoline UST was located near a former tire storage building near the northeast side of the Property.  Based on UST Removal Reports the USTs were removed in 1986. The UST removal report indicated the waste oil UST was in poor condition when removed and contamination was found near the former lubrication oil UST. Laboratory results indicated contamination was detected in soil and\/or groundwater under all the USTs except the former diesel UST. A former washing area with a clarifier that has been removed was located near the eastern corner of the Property    A February 10, 1988 memo from Alameda County Department of Environmental Health requested, groundwater wells be installed at the Site.  A handwritten note dated February 9, 1988 stated, “Requested verification of wells before closure of site will be confirmed.”  No later additional information regarding this issue was found according to the Phase I.  No additional subsurface sampling or monitoring well installation appeared to have been conducted.     In September 2018 additional subsurface investigations were conducted without regulatory oversight including the collection soil and groundwater samples from six locations on the Site including the vicinity of all the former UST locations. Results from these subsurface investigations indicated petroleum related constituents of concern (COCs )including but not limited to diesel and motor oil range total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH-d and TPH-mo, respectively), benzene, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE,) and tert butyl alcohol (TBA) were detected in the both the soil and groundwater.  Additionally non-petroleum COCs including but not limited to chloroform, methylene chloride, cis-1,2-dichloroethene (DCE), trichloroethene (TCE) and vinyl chloride were detected in soil and groundwater samples.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is located in a residential area in the Adams Point neighborhood of Oakland and is currently developed as a single-family residential home doing business as administrative offices for the East Bay Agency for Children.  The property consists of one parcel Assessor Parcel Number (APN) 10-775-1 and is located at the southeast corner of Van Buren Avenue and Lee Street.      In April 2019, one approximately 250-gallon single-walled steel home heating oil underground storage tank (UST) identified as UST 1 was removed from within the property line along Lee Street.  During removal activities  the UST was observed to be in poor condition with visible holes in the tank.  Based on information presented in the Underground Storage Tank Closure Report, dated May 9, 2019 and the Unauthorized Release Form, dated May 9, 2019 significant soil discoloration and hydrocarbon odors was observed in the UST excavation area.The associated fill port was reported at the west end of the tank and the bottom of the tank was reported at approximately 4.5 feet below ground surface (bgs). Groundwater was not observed in the UST excavation area. Residual liquid inside the UST was not reported during removal activities.    Two discrete soil samples (9781-East and 9781-West) were collected from approximately 2 feet below the east and west end of the former UST 1 location at a depth of approximately 6.5 feet below ground surface (bgs) and analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbon as diesel (TPH d); benzene toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX); naphthalene; fuel oxygenates and lead scavengers including ethylene dibromide (EDB), ethylene dichloride (EDC), methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE), diisopropyl ether (DIPE), tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA), and ethanol; and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs\/PNAs).  An additional three point composite sample was collected and analyzied for the same chemicals mentioned above for waste profiling.  Results indicated TPH-d was detected above laboratory detection limits in all samples with the highest concentration of 530 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) collected beneath the east end of the tank indicating an unauthorized release had occur at this site.  Additionally, several PAHs were detected in the discrete soil samples and soil stockpile.      Based on concentrations reported from 6.5 feet beneath the east and west ends of the former UST 1 area, over-excavation and additional soil sampling was conducted at the site in May 2019.  The UST 1 excavation pit was over-excavated to an approximate depth of 7 feet bgs.  Lateral over-excavation was not mentioned in the Report.  Subsequent to over-excavation two additional soil samples (9781-E-9 and 9781-W-9) were collected from approximately 9 feet bgs beneath the east and west ends of former UST and analyzed for same analytes mentioned above.   Results indicated TPH-d was detected above laboratory detection limits in all samples with the highest concentration of 2,900 mg\/kg collected beneath the west end of the tank. These concentrations were higher than the previous soil samples collected at 6 feet bgs.  Several PAHs were also detected in the 9 foot bgs soil samples including but not limited to increased concentrations of phenanthrene, pyrene, and 1-methylnaphthalene relative to the previous soil sampling event collected at 6 feet bgs.  The potential source of PAH is currently unknown.    In June 2019, an additional 130-gallon single-walled steel UST (UST 2) was removed from within the property line near Perkins Street and the adjacent residential property.  Information presented in the UST Closure Report, dated July 17, 2019  indicated UST 2 to be in good condition with no visible holes. The bottom of the tank was reported at approximately 6.5 feet bgs and the associated fill port was reported at the south end of the tank. Groundwater was not observed in the UST 2 excavation area.     One discrete soil sample (9781-C) was collected from the beneath the tank excavation floor at 8.5 feet bgs.  Additionally, one four-point composite soil simple (9781-SP) was collected from the stockpiled overburden soil.  Samples were analyzed for TPH d; BTEX; naphthalene; PAHs.  Results indicated several PAHs were detected in the discrete soil sample and soil overburden sample.  Similar to PAH detections at UST 1, the potential source of PAHs at UST 2 is currently unknown.    ACDEH has evaluated the data presented in the UST Removal Report, dated July 17, 2019 for UST 1 and UST 2, in conjunction with the case files, to determine if the site is eligible for closure as a low risk site under the State Water Resources Control Board’s Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (LTCP).  Based on ACDEH's review, we have determined that the site fails to meet the following criteria: LTCP General Criteria e (Site Conceptual Model) and f (Secondary Source Removal); Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater; Media Specific Criteria for Petroleum Vapor Intrusion to Indoor, and Media Specific Criteria for Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Exposure.  Please refer to the LTCP Checklist for additional information about each criteria.  Additionally, several PAHs were detected in both the UST 1 and UST 2, therefore, additional delineation to determine the source of PAH is required.    On August 14, 2019 Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) conducted a kick-off meeting with the responsible party (RP) and their environmental consultant as well as the potential buyer and their associated EC.  Brokers from both the RP and potential buyer were also present.  Discussions during the meeting included the submittal of a work plan for additional subsurface investigations including the advancement of additional bores for the collection of soil and groundwater, and potentially soil vapor.",

CC 1919 Market LP, the property owner of the approximately 1.5 acres Site, has completed the following corrective actions during redevelopment of the Site into four buildings with live-work units, communal courtyards, and parking:    1. Targeted remedial soil excavation to remove petroleum hydrocarbon and volatile organic compound (VOC) source areas associated with former operations at the Site with automotive repair, fuel dispensing, hazardous chemical storage, and painting.    2. Targeted remedial soil excavation of lead impacted soil within bioswale and planter areas.    3. Capping of residual impacted soil with physical barriers or Caps including building foundations, and geotextile demarcation layer across the soil outside the building footprints overlain by asphalt and concrete hardscape, and clean landscaping soil in the courtyards and parking lot to protect construction, landscape, and utility workers from residual lead impacted soil.     4. Installation of vapor intrusion mitigation and migration engineering controls (VIMMECs) consisting of vapor barrier membranes, passive sub-slab ventilation systems, and utility seals and trench dams at Building A, B, C and D to protect occupants of the buildings from residual VOCs in soil vapor.    5. Installation of environmental monitoring infrastructure consisting of sub-slab vapor probes, soil vapor probes, and radon meters to monitor the performance of VIMMECs and environmental conditions beneath and within Building A, B, C and D.    ACDEH provided approval of reports documenting the completion of the above listed corrective actions and phased clearance for occupancy of the Site in letters dated March 28, 2021 and March 28, 2022 and issued a letter on July 30, 2022 with ACDEH’s determination that no further remedial action is required at the Site and that long-term management of the environmental engineering controls will minimize risk to Site receptors from exposure to residual subsurface contamination at the Site by limiting potential exposure of occupants and construction\/maintenance workers to residual subsurface contamination in soil, soil vapor and groundwater to levels that are protective of human health.  Based on this determination, ACDEH changed the status of the environmental case from “Active – Remediation” to “Long-Term Management” conditioned upon recordation of institutional and administrative controls and long-term maintenance, management and reporting requirements for the environmental engineering controls at the Site.",

Current improvements to the Site reportedly consist of a 12,500-square foot one-story commercial building on a concrete slab, a 2,518-sqaure foot one-story commercial building on a concrete slab, and a 781 square foot one-story residential dwelling on a concrete perimeter foundation. Ground cover at the Site consists predominantly of hardscape and a portion of bare soil. The Site is currently occupied by a grocery store; the remaining structures on the Site consist of vacant homes a vacant commercial space. Land use in the vicinity of the Site is primarily commercial; there is one commercial gasoline station northwest of the Site across High Street, a muffler shop to the north of the Site across International Boulevard, and a retail shopping center to the northeast of the Site across International Boulevard. Historical land uses include a gasoline and auto service station in two separate locations, vulcanizing\/battery shops, a paint store and auto painting facility, and various other businesses that stored hazardous materials and\/or generated hazardous waste. Investigations at the Site have been ongoing to determine the extent of impacts to soil, groundwater and soil vapor from previous land uses to facilitate the proposed redevelopment .",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In 1999, a magnetometer survey detected the presence of five metal objects, including two located in MacArthur Boulevard (near center median).  Three were believed to be USTs, and uncertainty was present regarding the other two objects.  The property appears to have been a service station since the 1940’s, and a brake shop between the early 1960’s and the mid 1990’s; the site is currently unoccupied.  Soil bores installed in 2000 documented concentrations in groundwater up to 14,000 µg\/l TPHd, 13,000 µg\/l TPHg, and 4,100 µg\/l benzene.  No soil samples were collected.  DTSC conducted a preliminary assessment in 2001 and up to 36,400 mg\/kg TPHmo and 6,900 mg\/kg lead was documented in soil.  Soil bores installed in March 2003 documented concentrations up to 4,000 µg\/l TPHd, 37,000 µg\/l TPHg, and 5,800 µg\/l benzene.  In 2002 and 2004 DTSC required remediation of shallow soil to remove lead, TPH diesel, and TPH motor oil from soil.  An approximately 100 gallon waste oil UST was removed from the ground at the site in October 2004; however, the previous 1999 geophysical survey located additional buried metallic objects both onsite and offsite in MacArthur Boulevard; all may not be USTs.  The soil case received closure form DTSC on January 24, 2005 and the groundwater case was transferred to Alameda County at that time.  The downgradient, lateral, and vertical extent of contaminationv was not defined.      Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case are available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp. The case was transferred from Alameda County to the Water Board in 2012 for continued oversight of groundwater cleanup. Additional soil and groundwater sampling was conducted in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Based on the concentrations detected, the site met the criteria for closure under the Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy. The leaking underground storage tank case was closed in 2019. Information supporting the case closure are in GeoTracker.",

Interim remedial action was performed during the UST removal to address contaminated soil and ground water. Approximately 2,100 tons of contaminated soil were removed from the excavation.  Approximately 33,000 gallons of contaminated water was pumped from the tank pit for off-site disposal.  Approximately 1,700 tons of backfill was placed in the excavation.

Further review of the case files indicates that both cases apply to the same site and that the 1999 case closure closes the investigation and cleanup related to underground storage tanks at the site.    Approximately 1,400 cubic yards of soil that was impacted by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was excavated from three areas of the site.  The soil containing PAHs was used for road base under the parking lot and under a portion of a building.  Due to the PAHs in these areas, the site was closed in 1999 with site management requirements that  require review of the corrective action if land use changes.  The integrity of the asphalt and concrete cap over the soil containing PAHs is to be maintained.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has been providing regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003403 since July 2020 subsequent to referral by the City of Oakland Planning and Building Department.  To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as dry-cleaning and dying facilities, and machine shops.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil and soil vapor).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include the hazardous material survey and abatement of the existing onsite building and hardscape; demolition of existing Site buildings and above ground infrastructure; remedial soil excavation and off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; consolidation and capping of remaining impacted soil with backfill with clean fill; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes demolition of all existing structures across the entire Site and construction of a five-story 95,325-SF affordable housing facility with 77 units of affordable housing with retail on ground level and a multi-function courtyard along the southeast portion of the Site.      The Site is located in a mixed commercial and residential (primarily commercial) area of the San Antonio neighborhood in Oakland on along the southern portion of International Boulevard (formerly E. 14th Street) near the intersection between International Blvd and 22nd Ave.  The property consists of five adjacent parcels of land totaling approximately 38,475-square feet (SF) including assessor parcel numbers (APNs) 20-107-5-1, 20-106-1, 20-106-2, 20-106-3-1, &amp; 20-106-5. The Site includes the following addresses including: 2227, 2245, 2249, and 2257 International Boulevard and 2236 E 12th Street (respectively the Site).  The Site is currently developed with two one-story commercial buildings (2227 &amp; 2245 International Boulevard) and one two-story residential over commercial building (2257 International Boulevard) and associated paved and storage areas (2236 E 12th Street).  A portion of the Site is vacant including 2227 and a portion of 2245 International Blvd and a portion of 2236 E 12th St.  Occupied private residences and commercial operations including contractor office and roofing storage yard are located at 2257 International Blvd and a portion of 2245 International Blvd, respectively.    The Site is bound to the north by International Blvd and further by various commercial buildings; to the east by multi-tenant commercial property; to the south by mixed commercial and residential land-use; and to the west by commercial properties.      Historical operations at the Site included various facilities associated with recognized environmental conditions (RECs) from at least 1903 to approximately 1969.  These historical operations included but are not limited to dry cleaning and dying facilities, metal and machine shops, furniture manufacturing and refurnishing businesses, painting facilities, auto supply, poultry shop, trucking company, and material storage yard. A portion of the Site (2257 International Blvd) has been occupied by private residences from approximately 1911 to 1945 and 2016 to present, respectively.    Redevelopment plans include demolition of all existingstructures across the entire Site and construction of a five-story 95,325-SF affordable housing facility with 77 units of affordable housing with retail on ground level and a multi-function courtyard along the southeast portion of the Site.    Numerous Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs) were conducted by ACC Environmental Consultants (ACC) in November 2016 and August 2019 and prior in 2003 by Basic Environmental Inc at the Site.  The most recent 2016 and 2019 ESAs have been conducted on behalf of Satellite Affordable Housing Associates (SAHA). The Phase I ESA completed by ACC and dated November 15, 2016, indicated the Site was developed with three commercial buildings and associated asphalt\/concrete-paved areas and occupied by Iglesia Mission Evangelica del Pricipe de Paz, Sam Jin Roofing, Pac Man Beat Shop, and private residences and used as a church, roofing material storage, auto audio installation facility, and residential apartments, respectively.  ACC identified REC including various facilities indicative of hazardous materials storage, use, and generation from at least 1903 to 1969. These facilities included dry cleaning and dyeing facilities, metal and machine shops, and painting facilities. In addition, historic site use of adjacent properties includes equipment rental companies, auto body and repair shops, and gasoline stations.    In addition, ACC referenced a previous Phase I ESA  conducted by Basics Environmental, Inc. and dated 2003. According to the previous report, a citizen’s  complaint was issued on September 5, 1986, regarding the use of diesel fuel to kill weeds along the front of a retail storefront utilized as a chocolate bakery (2259 International Boulevard) and located on the Site.    The 2019 Phase I ESA was conducted as part of SAHA’s due diligence effort toward developing the property with a residential building on all the Site parcels. Conclusions from the Phase I ESAs indicated that no recognized environmental conditions (RECs) were present at the Site in connection with historic and\/or current Site uses.  However, the Phase I ESAs identified lead impacted to soil from previous environmental subsurface investigation conducted in 2017 and presented in Phase II ESA, dated January 31, 2017 and prepared by ACC on behalf of SAHA. Additional conclusions in the ESAs recommended development of a Soil Management Plan. The Phase I ESA completed by ACC and dated November 15, 2016, indicated the Site was developed with three commercial buildings and associated asphalt\/concrete-paved areas and occupied by Iglesia Mission Evangelica del Pricipe de Paz, Sam Jin Roofing, Pac Man Beat Shop, and private residences and used as a church, roofing material storage, auto audio installation facility, and residential apartments, respectively.    Currently electronic or hard copies of the previous Phase I ESA completed by ACC and dated November 15, 2016 or Phase I ESA conducted by Basic in 2003 have not been provided to Alameda County Department of Environmental Health.    Results from the Phase II ESA Report, dated January 31, 2017, indicated shallow soil (2 feet below ground surface; bgs) detections above regulatory guidelines for commercial and residential direct contact for metals including lead and nickel.  Additionally, petroleum- and non-petroleum-related constituents of concern (COCs) including total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) including diesel- and motor oil- range TPH (TPH-d, and TPH-mo) and acetone and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) were detected below regulatory guidelines in soil.  Grab groundwater results indicated non-petroleum related COC including acetone, chloroform, MEK, and tert-butyl alcohol were detected.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site Background: The Site is located on a parcel of approximately ¼ acre within a mixed commercial and residential area in central Oakland. Petroleum contamination was first reported at the Site in 1986, following the excavation and removal of four 12,000-gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs), one 10,000-gallon diesel UST and one 500-gallon waste oil UST. The primary chemicals of concern are petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants which have been detected in soil, groundwater, and soil vapor.     Previous Cleanup Activities: Since the removal of the USTs there have been no additional cleanup activities at the Site. Additional investigation activities report that piping associated with the former service station remains on the Site and that soil petroleum contamination remains in soil and groundwater from the former USTs.     Proposed Cleanup: The Responsible Party has proposed excavation to a depth of 12 feet in the area of the former gasoline and diesel USTs and dispenser islands, and removal of the remaining piping that will result in the disposal of approximately 800-900 cubic yards of petroleum-contaminated soil. The excavations will be backfilled with concrete and clean soil. The excavation of the contaminated soil is expected to take approximately up to two weeks to complete. To facilitate cleanup, the automobiles will be removed, and the existing canopy will be demolished. The details of the proposed cleanup are described in the May 5, 2022 Focused Feasibility Study and Corrective Action Plan (FFS\/CAP). ACDEH has required that the corrective action is comprised of the advancement of narrow, discreet excavation strips (slot trenching) to limit the exposure of contaminated soil and reduce potential for petroleum odors.     ACDEH will be accepting comments to the FFS\/CAP for a 30-day period, ending August 1, 2022. ACDEH will respond to all comments received prior to final approval of the corrective action. To provide comment or request information about the proposed cleanup, please contact Noel Liner of ACDEH (email: noel.liner@acgov.org).",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    According to County of Alameda’s Assessor’s Office Property Value System the Site has been an active service station since at least January of 1966.  At the time of closure of LUST Case No. RO0000076 \/ TO600100302 the site is utilized as an active Westco Gasoline-branded retail fuel dispensing facility.  Site features include a service station building, three dispenser islands, and four 10,000-gallon double-wall fiberglass gasoline underground storage tanks.  With the exception of landscaped planters along portions of the property boundary and the station building, the site is covered with asphalt and\/or concrete.    The site is located at the southeastern corner of the intersection of West MacArthur Boulevard and West Street in Oakland, California.  The site is mostly surrounded by a mix of commercial, industrial, and residential properties.    Monitoring wells A-1 through A-8 were installed in two phases in December 1982 and March 1983 (A-5 to A-8 were installed by Groundwater Technology, Inc).  Documentation of the installations has not been found; however, an undocumented tank replacement is reported to have occurred in August 1983.  In October 1987, Pacific Environmental Group (PEG) installed four monitoring wells (A-9 through A-12) at the site.  Subsequently, an Unauthorized Release Form was submitted in October 1987.    Between November 1991 and April 1992, four single-walled underground storage tanks consisting of one 12,000-gallon fiberglass UST, two 8,000-gallon steel USTs and one 6,000-gallon steel UST) and associated product piping were removed from the site.  All are reported to have dispensed gasoline.  TPHg and benzene were detected at concentrations up to 430 mg\/kg and 24 mg\/kg, respectively, in soil sample SW12 collected at 12 feet bgs.  Following UST pit over-excavation, ROUX stated that maximum residual TPH-g and benzene concentrations remaining in the UST cavity were detected at 250 mg\/kg and 2.7 mg\/kg, respectively.       Product line samples documented concentrations up to 8,300 mg\/kg TPHg, 3.1 mg\/kg benzene, 23 mg\/kg toluene, 40 mg\/kg ethylbenzene and 300 mg\/kg total xylenes in sample L6 at 3.5 feet bgs.  Elevated product line samples were subsequently also overexcavated and removal was confirmed with subsequent deeper samples at 7 to 7.5 feet bgs.  Following over-excavation of the product piping, maximum residual TPH-g and benzene concentrations remaining in the piping trenches were detected 400 mg\/kg and 2.6 mg\/kg, respectively, detected in sample L12 collected at 7.5 ft bgs.  Approximately 1,900 cubic yards of soil was excavated during the removal of the former USTs and conveyance piping and the excavation of the current UST pit.    In January 1992, GeoStrategies, Inc. (GSI) installed one vapor extraction well (AV-1) to conduct a vapor extraction test.  GSI concluded that vapor extraction did not create significant pressure influence at the closest vapor monitoring point location four feet from the vapor extraction point and subsequently vapor extraction was not considered a viable or feasible remediation option for the site.    In November 1992, three recovery wells (AR-1 through AR-3) were installed at the site to facilitate groundwater extraction and abate free product detected in monitoring wells A-4 and A-8.  The groundwater extraction system operated from November 1992 to June 1996.  The system operated and removed approximately 4,643,696 gallons of groundwater with approximately 2.74 pounds (0.45 gallons) of TPHg and 0.46 pounds (0.06 gallons) of benzene during the operation of the system.   As of December 31, 1995, 23 pounds (3.75 gallons) of separate phase hydrocarbons (SPH) had been removed from the site by the GWETS or by hand bailing.    Soil bores SB-1A, and SB-2 through SB-6 were installed in October 2010 up to 35 feet bgs to characterize soil beneath the site.  Concentrations up to 1,400 mg\/kg TPHg, 5.2 mg\/kg benzene, 17 mg\/kg ethylbenzene and 110 mg\/kg total xylenes were detected in SB-1A at a depth of 25 feet bgs.  This location is immediately west and adjacent to the former UST and product line overexcavation samples collected in 1991 \/ 1992, and based on the analytical sample location, depths, and results, represents residual contamination below a depth of approximately 20 feet bgs at the site.    Downgradient and offsite soil bore SB-7 and onsite soil vapor wells SV-7 and SV-8 were installed in Mary 2015 and were analyzed for TPHg, BTEX, naphthalene, and fuel oxygenates and lead scavengers.  All concentrations were non-detectable at standard limits of reporting.    Soil bores SB-08 to SB-11, and soil vapor well SV-9 were installed in November 2016 along the eastern property line, and were analyzed for TPHg, BTEX, naphthalene, and fuel oxygenates and lead scavengers.  In general most soil samples yielded non-detectable concentrations at standard limits of reporting; however, concentrations up to 990 mg\/kg TPHg, &lt;3.6 mg\/kg benzene, 11.0 mg\/kg ethylbenzene, and &lt;7.20 mg\/kg total xylenes were detected in soil sample SB-10 at a depth of 20.5 feet     : Crawl space, basement, and outdoor air vapor samples were collected at the site between October 2017 and January 2018, and at an adjacent residence.  Vapor samples were analyzed for TPHg, BTEX, MTBE, TBA, naphthalene.    This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  ACDEH determined that the site meets all the LTCP General Criteria and Media Specific Criteria and therefore poses a low risk to human health and safety and the environment.  Two adjacent residential properties were additionally evaluated for the risk of vapor intrusion due to the presence of basements.  One basement and crawl space was evaluated further due to conflicting analytical data, and based on two seasonal crawl space, indoor air, and outdoor vapor sampling events, the basement and crawl space meets residential Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs).  These determinations were based on receptors and environmental conditions identified at and in the vicinity of the site at the time of closure and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Two USTs one 675-gallon gasoline and one 340-gallon waste-oil UST were removed in August 1996 from the sidewalk.  The product piping was left in place.  Obvious gasoline contaminated soil was removed up to the foundation of the building, utilities, and a large tree but appears to have been laterally limited due to these structures.  Maximum concentrations of 14,000 mg\/kg TPHg, 9.8 mg\/kg benzene, and 24µg\/kg PCE were detected in overexcavation samples.  Groundwater monitoring wells MW-1 to MW-3, and soil bores B1 to B3 were installed in 1998 and 1999.  Soil bores B7 to B11 were installed in October 2002, soil bores B12 to B24, and hydropunch bores HB-1 to HB-6 were installed in April and June 2005.  Bores B25 to B27 and Soil Gas wells SG-1 to SG-3 were installed in August 2013.  Soil bores B28 to B35 were installed in November 2015.  Soil bores B36 to B44 and soil vapor bores B37V to B42V were installed in October 2017 and January 2019.  Residual soil and groundwater concentrations provide indirect evidence of residual NAPL at the site and a draft Corrective Action Plan has been requested.     Site investigation was performed in May 1998 and groundwater monitoring wells installed detected maximum concentrations of 290,000 µg\/L TPHg, 28,000 µg\/L benzene and 1,900 µg\/L MTBE.    Product piping was removed from beneath the sidewalk in late 2002.  Currently, additional investigation is proposed.",

To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil, soil vapor, and groundwater).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include the hazardous material survey and abatement of the existing onsite building and hardscape; demolition of existing Site home; remedial soil excavation and off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to prevent migration along new utility corridors.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes 6 to 8 two story residential units.      The subject site (the Site) is located in a mixed residential and commercial area of Oakland and consists of one parcel (Alameda County Assessor Parcel Number (APN) 33-2168-7) located in the vicinity of the on-ramp to Interstate-880 near High Street.  The Site is bound to the north and south by residential single-family homes.  The Site is bound to the east by 39th Avenue and further by residential homes.  Various commercial businesses including but not limited to a smog shop and a towing company are located adjacent west of the Site.  A former Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Case, On Time Towing (Case No. 01-2086 and RO0000658), is located approximately 145 feet adjacent southwest,of the Site. a Stalled open LUST Case (Case Number 01-2442, RO0000089) is located approximately 280 feet northeast of the Site.  Groundwater data associated with the northern LUST indicates groundwater depth has been detected between 9 to 20 feet below ground surface (bgs) with a gradient flow south toward the San Francisco Bay tidal canal located approximately 2,200 feet southwest of the Site.    The Site is approximately 0.14 acres and is currently developed with a vacant single family residential structure with covered garage area and backyard.  Based on information provided in the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Report (Phase I), dated July 9, 2019, prepared by Stantec, the layout of the residential structures have been in the general same configuration since the 1930's.    Redevelopment is proposed at the property and will include 6-8 residential units.  Additional details regarding the redevelopment plan have not been provided to Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) at this time. Currently the developer has submitted a planning application (PLN 19258) which is under review with the City of Oakland planning department.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently a retail shopping center consisting of commercial buildings and a parking area.  Surrounding land use is mixed residential and commercial.  Prior to development of the site as a retail shopping center in 1986, the site was a gasoline service station.  The MacArthur BART station is located approximately 500 feet west of the site.  Construction of a transit village is planned for the BART parking lot, which is approximately 130 feet southwest (downgradient) of the site.    In July 1982, Shell reported a fuel leak at the site.  Eight groundwater monitoring wells (B-1 through B-8) were installed on the site in July 1982 to define the potential extent of contamination.  From 1982 to 1987, free product was observed in on-site groundwater monitoring wells B-3, B-4, B-6, and B-8, with an increasing thickness trend occurring in the summer when water tables were lower.  Up to six feet of free product was observed in well B-4 during the period between 1982 and 1987.  Between September 1982 and July 1983, approximately 4.19 gallons of free product was removed by manual bailing and periodic batch extraction using a vacuum truck.    Additional monitoring wells B-9 through B-11 and recovery wells R-1 and R-2 were installed between June and October 1983.  No reports document the operation of recovery wells R-1 and R-2, which were subsequently removed in November 1983 during tank removal.      The first-generation tanks were reportedly removed in November 1983, with no reports documenting the excavation.  Following the 1983 tank removal, three 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs were installed in 1984 and subsequently removed on September 25, 1986.  Shell Oil Company owned the site until 1986.  The commercial shopping center which currently occupies the site was constructed in January 1987 and covered previous wells.      Soil lithology consists of silty clay with trace to slight amounts of sand and gravel.  The groundwater gradient at the site has varied between the west, south, and southeast. Depth to water has historically varied between 8.42 feet below ground surface (fbgs) and 19.35 fbgs.  Residual contamination appears to be typically encountered at a depth of approximately 10 fbgs.    Four soil borings were advanced east of the former USTs in May and September 1989 and completed as groundwater monitoring wells MW-2 through MW-5.  Soil samples were collected from the borings between 4 and 16 feet below ground surface (fbgs).  The soil sample collected from boring MW-3 at 10 fbgs contained the only reported concentrations of TPHg, benzene, and xylenes at concentrations of 28 ppm, 0.054 ppm, and 0.099 ppm, respectively.      Between October and December 1989, four soil borings were advanced (CSB-1, OMW-6, OMW-9, and OMW-10).    The maximum concentration of TPHg in soil was detected off-site in boring OMW-9 at a concentration of 210 ppm.  The maximum on-site concentration of TPHg in soil was 18 ppm, collected from boring OMW-6 at a depth of 10 fbgs.      Monitoring well MW-8 and extraction well EW-1 were installed on June 27 and 28, 1990.  Soil samples were collected from the borings between 6 and 20 fbgs.  Soil collected from boring EW-1 at 10 fbgs contained the only detections of TPHg and TPHd at concentrations of 110 ppm and 4.4 ppm, respectively.  The soil from boring EW-1 also contained the only detections of BTEX.      Off-site monitoring wells OMW-11 through OMW-13 were installed on November 20 and 22, 1991.  Soil samples were collected from the borings between 5 and 15 fbgs.  The only soil contamination detected was 56 ppm TPHmo, collected from boring OMW-12 at a depth of 4.5 fbgs.      No activities other than groundwater monitoring appear to have take place between 1991 and November 2004.  On November 18, 2004, wells EW-1, MW-4, MW-5, OMW-10, OMW-11, and OMW-12 were decommissioned.    Two nested soil vapor probes (SVP-1 and SVP-2) and two sub-slab vapor probes (SVP-3 and SVP-4) were installed on October 25, 2011.  The probes were sampled on November 30, 2011 and January 18, 2012.  Sub-slab probes SVP-3 and SVP-4 did not contain TPHg or benzene at concentrations above reporting limits of 3,800 and 16 micrograms per cubic meter (µg\/m3), respectively.  Toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes were detected in sub-slab probes SVP-3 and SVP-4 at maximum concentrations of 20, 82, and 110 µg\/m3, respectively.  These concentrations are below residential and commercial Environmental Screening Levels.    Off-site groundwater was most recently sampled on March 26, 2012.  Groundwater samples from wells on the south side of 40th Street contained up to 2,900 ppb TPHg, 1,200 ppb TPHd, and 2.9 ppb benzene.   Well OMW-6, the closest off-site boring to the property, was last sampled on November 26, 2011.  During the November 26, 2011 sampling event, groundwater from well OMW-6 contained 7,000 ppb TPHg, 2,000 ppb TPHd, and 2.3 ppb benzene.      Groundwater monitoring has been conducted at the site since 1982.  The monitoring data indicate that the plume generally appears to be stable with slowly decreasing trends in concentrations.  Based on the evidence in provided reports, the residual contamination on-site and off-site of soil, groundwater, and soil vapor is not suspected to pose a threat to human or environmental health.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (Water Board) announces a proposed soil cleanup plan for Parcel T-12, located in downtown Oakland at 601 12th Street (the Site) between Martin Luther King Jr. Way, Jefferson Street, 11th Street, and 12th Street.  The proposed soil cleanup plan consists of excavation and off-site disposal of impacted Site soils.      We invite any interested parties to comment on the proposed cleanup plan.  Written comments are due to the Water Board at the above address by November 8, 2008.       Background  The Site was occupied by the old Oakland High School from late 1800s through the 1940s.  The building was demolished in 1944 and replaced by a parking lot.  Reported land use between 1920 and 1960 within one block of the Site has included manufacturing and machine shops, paint companies, auto-repair \/ service stations, printers \/ publishers, and dry cleaning establishments.      The Site presently consists of a level asphalt public parking lot, approximately 1.4 acres in size.  Surrounding land use is mix used of commercial, residential and parks.    Oakland T12 LLC (T12) and the City of Oakland Community and Economic Development Agency plan to develop the Site into a 23-story high-rise office building with two levels of basement parking starting in the fall of 2008.  As part of the design, the Site will be excavated to approximately 27 feet below ground surface (bgs), and approximately 60,000 cubic yards of soil will be removed.  The Site is shown on the attached map and aerial photograph.      The Water Board is the lead regulatory agency overseeing soil and groundwater cleanup activities at this Site     Site Investigation  Environmental investigations at the Site included the collection of soil samples and the installation of monitoring wells for groundwater sample collection.      The Site is underlain by fill consisting of silty to gravelly sand with brick fragments ranging in depth from 4 to 13 feet below ground surface.  Native material consisting of silty to clayey sands underlies the fill.  Soil in a small area of the Site is impacted with lead, arsenic, thallium and petroleum hydrocarbons (oil and grease) at concentrations slightly above environmental screening levels.      Groundwater beneath the site has not been impacted.       Proposed Cleanup Plan   The proposed cleanup plan consists of excavation and removal of impacted Site soils.  The Site hot spot soils will be excavated to the top of the native soil and disposed off-site in appropriate landfills.  Confirmation soil samples will be collected from the sidewalls and base of the excavation to confirm the impacted soils are excavated and removed to the extent possible.  Dust control, air monitoring and Site access controls will be implemented during soil excavation and removal activities at the Site.  The excavation of soil at the Site is anticipated to take approximately 4 to 6 weeks.  Truck traffic associated with the removal of excavated soil will be via 11th and 12th Streets and Interstate 980.    We invite any interested parties to comment on the proposed cleanup plan.  Written comments are due to the Water Board at the above address by November 8, 2008.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at https:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    A retail gasoline station operated at the site from the mid-1950s to circa 1969. The Thompsons purchased the property from Burmah Oil and Gas in 1973.  The property was a vacant lot at the time of the purchase.  In August 1999 a subsurface investigation was completed in advance of a potential property transaction, and revealed the presence of significantly elevated levels of hydrocarbon contamination in soil and groundwater beneath the site. However, no evidence of USTs were encountered during the investigation and there is no record of the removal of the USTs.  A magnetometer survey did not reveal the presence of USTs.  Site characterization performed in 2007 and 2008 confirmed the presence of elevated levels of contamination. In November 2008 a DPE pilot test was completed and results from the pilot test indicate that DPE is feasible and readily implemented.  DPE operated January 18, 2010 through July 23. 2010 and May 5, 2011 through October 31, 2011.      Confirmation sampling documented in report dated March 19, 2013 revealed elevated residual concentrations of TPHg and EX.  ACEH requested supplemental samples be collected due to inconsistencies with the reported data.  The second set of confirmation soil sample data, presented in a report dated January 3, 2014, indicated the site met the LTCP closure requirements.    Under the current land use as a vacant, unpaved parcel zoned for commercial\/light industrial land use, within an industrial \/ commercial \/ residential area, case closure is granted for future industrial \/ commercial land use.    If a change in land use to any residential, or other conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, Alameda County Environmental health (ACEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACEH will re-evaluate the case upon receipt of approved development\/construction plans.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    Due to the presence of contaminated groundwater underlying the site, future installation of private, domestic wells is prohibited.    This site is to be entered into the City of Oakland Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is located on the eastern corner of 22nd Avenue and East 12th Street in Oakland, California.  Land use in the vicinity of the site is mixed-use commercial\/industrial and residential.  The site is currently owned and operated by Mr. Stanley Wong and Mr. Aaron Wong as a Valero-branded service station.      June 1988 - Groundwater monitoring wells MW9A through MW9C were installed and quarterly monitoring was initiated.    September 1988 - Thirteen soil-gas probes were advanced.  The maximum concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) and benzene in soil-gas were reported in sample SG01 at 700,000 micrograms per liter (µg\/L) and 320,000 µg\/L, respectively.  The maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene in groundwater were reported in sample WS02 at 25,000 µg\/L and 12,000 µg\/L, respectively.    October and November 1988 - Soil borings MW9D through MW9H, SB1, B9-1, and B9-2 were advanced.  Soil borings MW9D through MW9H were completed as groundwater monitoring wells MW9D through MW9H.  Maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene were reported at 1,900 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) and 0.30 mg\/kg, respectively, in soil samples collected from boring MW9E at 5.5 feet below ground surface (bgs) and SB1 at 4.8 feet bgs.    January 1989 - Borings SB4 through SB9 were advanced up to 9 feet bgs.  Maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene were 160 mg\/kg (SB4, 4.0 feet bgs) and 1.0 mg\/kg (SB4, 4.0 feet bgs).    February 1989 - Slug tests were performed on on-site wells MW9B and MW9E.  The range for estimated hydraulic conductivity at the site is 0.42 foot per day and 0.52 foot per day.    March 1989 - Soil borings SB10 and SB11 were advanced to 10 feet bgs.  Concentrations of TPHg and benzene were not reported at or above laboratory reporting limits in the samples collected at 5 and 10 feet bgs from the borings.     September 1989 – Soil borings SB-12 through SB-20 were advanced up to 5 feet bgs.  TPHg was reported in each boring at concentrations up to 42 mg\/kg (SB-17, 5 feet bgs).  Benzene was reported in five of the borings at concentrations up to 0.21 mg\/kg (SB-16, 4.5 feet bgs).    October 1990 - Excavation activities were conducted between the southwestern product dispensers and the sidewalk.  Soil containing hydrocarbon concentrations greater than 100 mg\/kg was removed from the area (approximately 12 by 23 feet).  Soil was excavated to a depth of approximately 7 feet bgs.  Maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene were reported in boring S5 at 5 feet bgs at 290 mg\/kg and 2.8 mg\/kg, respectively.      October and November 1990 - Groundwater monitoring well MW9E was destroyed because it was located inside of the excavation boundaries.  Groundwater monitoring well MW9I was installed in approximately the same location as well MW9E after the excavation was backfilled.    September 1991 - Woodward-Clyde Consultants removed two 10,000-gallon USTs, one 7,500-gallon UST, and product piping.  The USTs were constructed of single-wall steel.  The USTs were replaced with three 12,000-gallon double-wall fiberglass USTs.  The product lines were also replaced with double-wall fiberglass lines.  Soil samples were collected from the tank hole and the product line trench during excavation.  TPHg and benzene were reported in tank pit samples at concentrations up to 1,100 mg\/kg and 0.88 mg\/kg, respectively, during excavation and 2.5 mg\/kg and 0.078 mg\/kg, respectively, after excavation.  TPHg and benzene were reported in product line trench at concentrations up to 1,200 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg, respectively, during excavation and 1.5 mg\/kg and 0.68 mg\/kg, respectively, after excavation.    April 1996 - A utility trench survey was conducted.  It was concluded that the utility trenches in the vicinity of the site were not acting as preferential pathways for petroleum hydrocarbon migration.    September 1997 - A 550-gallon used-oil UST was removed from the site.  Soil sample WO-10’ was collected from the native soil beneath the UST.  Concentrations of 11 mg\/kg TPHg, 440 mg\/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), and 0.024 ppm benzene were reported in the sample.  No volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or semi-VOCs were detected in soil.    June 1999 – Environmental Resolutions, Inc. (ERI) submitted a Report of Findings, detailing groundwater gradient and flow direction at the site and utility line depth.  ERI concluded that it did not appear that utilities were acting as preferential pathways for petroleum hydrocarbon migration based on their depth.    April 2000 - Exxon Company, U.S.A. sold the property, including the UST system, to Valero Energy Corporation.    January to March 2001 - Vapor point wells VP1 and VP2 were installed and a DPE feasibility test was performed.  During the test, TPHg removal rates were calculated at 5.6 pounds per day and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) removal rates were calculated at 0.08 pound per day.    June 2003 - DPE wells DPE1 through DPE4 were installed.  TPHg and benzene were not detected in soil samples collected from the borings except for benzene in boring DPE1 at 20 feet bgs at 0.0011 mg\/kg.    January 2004 - A DPE system was operated from January 2004 to July 2008.  Approximately 976.3 pounds of TPHg, 8.6 pounds of benzene, and 38.3 pounds of MTBE were removed during this period.      August and September 2007 - Borings DP1 through DP6 were advanced to approximately 30 feet bgs using dual-wall direct-push equipment to define the offsite and vertical depth of MTBE and TBA.  MTBE was detected at a maximum concentration of 0.990 mg\/kg and TBA was detected at 1.3 mg\/kg.

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    In December 1996 the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) removed a 4,000-gallon single wall fiberglass heating oil underground storage tank (UST) that had historically been used to heat the pool. During removal of the UST, the tank ruptured releasing petroleum hydrocarbon fuel oil to the tank excavation. Free product mixed with groundwater was removed from the tank pit, contaminated soil was over-excavated, and an observation well was installed in the tank backfill. As a result of the release, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) opened Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Cleanup Program Case No. RO0000292 to provide regulatory oversight of the investigation and cleanup of the fuel release. Groundwater sample analytical results collected from the observation well in 1997 detected petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd) at 130,000 ug\/l, and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) concentrations at 3.3 micrograms per liter (ug\/l), 4.7 ug\/l, 9.6 ug\/l, and 40 ug\/l respectively. The OUSD environmental consultant concluded that the elevated concentrations of TPHd were likely a result of turbidity in the sample since no evidence of free product was observed in the well, and recommended that an additional groundwater sample be collected and field filtered prior to analysis by the laboratory for TPHd, and oxygen releasing compound be injected into groundwater at the observation well to enhance natural biodegradation of residual diesel constituents. ACDEH concurred that the TPHd result may be skewed high and requested an additional groundwater sampling event be conducted by June 1997. Results of the additional groundwater monitoring event were never submitted to ACDEH.     A Notice of Violation was issued by ACDEH LOP on July 24, 2009 for failure to upload data and documents. A work plan was conditionally approved in November 2016, and an extension allowed due to the retirement of the consultant. In June 2019 a Notice to Comply directive was issued to OUSD for non-compliance with implementation of the for the Site in order to regain compliance.     In July 2019, OUSD met with ACDEH to discuss conducting verification monitoring to complete the close-out activities for the former petroleum UST. In August 2019 a water sample was collected from the tank backfill piezometer and submitted for laboratory analysis. Low detections of petroleum hydrocarbon constituents were detected in the sample.No other volatile organic compounds were detected. In December 2019 four borings were advanced around the former tank pit for collection of verification samples. Petroleum constituents were detected at low concentrations supporting closure of the Fuel Leak Case. Non-petroleum volatile organic compounds including trichloroethylene were detected in the groundwater. In February2020 additional groundwater samples were collected along the upgradient direction of the former tank pit to verify that the TCE is related to an off-site source.",

During the removal of two hydraulic hoists in 1993, visibly stained soil was observed at the base of each hoist excavation beginning at 8 feet bgs.  Excavation could not be continued due to the proximity of the excavation to the building foundation.  Chlorinated solvents, primarily PCE, were detected in groundwater beneath the  site.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "A previous fuel leak case for this site (ADCEH case RO0000469 and Global ID T0600101272) was closed on May 4, 2011.  During the removal of three underground storage tanks on January 29, 2013, holes were observed in the end of one UST and petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil samples collected from the tank pit excavation.  Additional site investigation that included soil, soil gas, and groundwater sampling, was conducted in February and March 2015 detected petroleum hydrocarbons at elevated concentrations in the central portion of the site.  The property owner has submitted plans to construct a mixed commercial and residential building that includes a subsurface garage.  ACDEH requested a Corrective Action Plan that evaluates potential human health risks for the planned redevelopment and presents plans for cleanup and\/or mitigation prior to or during site development. A work plan for removal of petroleum impacted soil was submitted in response to ACDEH's directive for a CAP.  However, based on a stakeholder meeting conducted on September 13, 2016, ACDEH wrote a directive requesting additional information on the status of the entitlement process for the proposed redevelopment. As of 6\/27\/17, no information has been provided, and therefore, the case will be evaluated for closure, based on the existing land use.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The City of Oakland Fire Department, Hazardous Materials Management Program performed oversight for removal of the three single-walled steel underground storage tanks in February 2013.  Tank No.1 was located adjacent to the maintenance building and more than 150 feet away from Tank Nos. 2 and 3, which were located inside the maintenance building at the former Bay Bridge Toll Plaza. Tank Nos. 1 and 3 were found to be filled with sand slurry from a 1996 in-place closure. Approximately 1,100 gallons of petroleum-impacted groundwater was removed from the UST #1 excavation after the tank was removed from the ground. Approximately 165 tons of petroleum impacted soil was removed to a depth of 8 feet below grade surface (bgs) after Tank Nos. 2 and 3 were removed from their common excavation. The Toll Plaza area where the tanks were located is underlain by a concrete pile platform situated approximately 12 feet bgs, which effectively serves as a concrete floor underlying the Bay Bridge Toll Plaza area. Excavation below this depth at the site is not possible. The Regional Board has determined that site management requirements are warranted in the event that contractors perform subsurface activities in the vicinity of the former tanks and encounter residual petroleum hydrocarbon impacated soil or groundwater. Site management requirements are specified in Section IV Closure of the Case Closure Summary.  Photos taken during removal of the tanks are shown in Appendix A of the Geocon's April 2013 Underground Storage Tank Removal Report (see site documents\/reports).",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has been providing regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003269 since November 2017 subsequent to referral by the City of Oakland Planning and Building Department.  To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various industrial facilities including steel and iron fabrication, fireworks manufacturing, and auto parts manufacturing.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil and soil vapor).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include; remedial soil exavation with consolidation and capping; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.  Redevelopment of the site is proposed to be completed in phases with the first phase consisting of modular housing for permanent homeless supportive units.  Phase I includes 2 L-shaped, slab-on-grade multi-story mixed-use residential buildings.  No underground parking is proposed for development of the Site.        This case applies to one address located at 800 Pine Street in Oakland (APN: 6-47-1).  The Alameda County Parcel Viewer page indicates the property as 800 Cedar Street, however, Cedar Street no longer exists.  Currently, the site is managed under Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) case RO0003269, however, a separate LOP Case No. RO0000417 was historically associated with a former UST release that was located on a portion of the parcel that is no longer a part of the existing property. This site was formerly managed as a Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) case, Phoenix 800 Property, Envirostor ID 01330037.  On November 21, 2017 the responsible party entered into a Voluntary Remedial Action Program Agreement with ACDEH, with concurrence from the DTSC, to provide regulatory oversight for a proposed redevelopment project.    The site is currently a vacant lot with a concrete slab from a former building covering the majority of the property.  The site is located in a mixed residential and commercial area boarded by Pine Street and Shorey Street to the east and south, respectively.  The site is bordered to the north by 9th Street and the west by an access ramp for Interstate 880 (I-880).  The site lies at an elevation of approximately 15 feet above mean sea level.  Historical data indicates the groundwater has been observed at approximately 5 to 7 feet below ground surface (bgs).    Historically the site has generally been occupied by industrial facilities including steel and iron fabrication, fireworks manufacturing, and auto parts manufacturing.  Sanborn Fire Insurance maps indicated from approximately 1912 to 1931, Independent Iron Works operated in the southern half of the site and California Fireworks Company operated in the northwestern portion of the site.  Independent Iron Works reportedly occupied the entire site from 1924 to 1960’s to manufacture steel products.  Between 1970 and 1994 the site was owned by Phoenix Properties, which operated Phoenix Iron Works on the western property boundary site.  Based on review of historical documents, additionally industrial activities under Phoenix Properties were conducted on portions of the site including; Stoltz\/Bond Metal Shop in the central portion, Pine Iron Works in the southeastern portion, and Cypress Auto Salvage Warehouse on the easternportion.  In 1994 the property was purchased by California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) which used the property for temporary storage of construction material.  At the time of Caltrans’ acquisition, the site contained an industrial warehouse constructed on a concrete slab.  In 1995 the warehouse structure, which encompassed the entire site, was removed leaving the concrete slab in place.  Construction activities were also conducted in the southwestern corner of the site for the frontage road during re-alignment of I-880.",

The site consists of numerous parcels located along Broadway, 51st, and Desmond Street within a mixed commercial and residential area of Oakland.  A mixed commercial and residential development is planned for the site.  Development plans include the excavation and removal of approximately 38,000 cubic yards of soil.  Subsurface investigation has detected lead and petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater at the site.  A former dry cleaner is reported to have been present at the site.  Alameda County Environmental Health entered into a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement with the site developer to provide oversight of investigation and cleanup activities during redevelopment.  Multiple investigations to characterize soil for contamination, pre-characterize waste, and offsite transport.    In general four primary areas of soil contamination were documented at the site; however, other areas of contamination were documented and remediated.  The four primary areas included three areas of shallow near-surface lead and TPH contamination (northwestern, northern, and southern), and one area of deeper TPH contamination (southern eastern parcel).  Pre-mass grading excavation of shallow lead and TPH contamination was conducted in the northwestern, northern, and southern areas of the site.  Subsequently excavation in the southern portion of the eastern parcel was conducted to remove lead and TPH contaminated soil in conjunction with mass grading for the site.  Additional removal of lead contaminated soil in the northwestern area was also later conducted.",

Stained soil with a petroleum hydrocarbon odor was observed in the four walls and bottom of the excavation; soil samples collected during the removal of the UST detected maximum concentrations of 140 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) total oil and grease (TOG) and 23 mg\/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd) at 8-feet below ground surface (bgs).  Based upon the age and condition of the former UST, the reported occurrence of oil and grease detected in the two collected soil samples, the observed stained soil around the UST, and the observed holes in the UST at removal, it was determined that an unauthorized release had occurred and this Leaking Underground Fuel Tank (LUFT) case was opened to investigate the release.    Environmental investigations have occurred periodically since 1993 and have included installation of a groundwater monitoring well and collection of soil and groundwater samples.",

The extents of soil, groundwater, and soil vapor contamination have not yet been fully characterized spatially or temporally. Because the Site is currently unoccupied, there are currently no on-site receptors; However, vapor intrusion risk for off-site receptors, specifically residences in the vicinity of the Site has not yet been evaluated. As such, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) considers the potential vapor intrusion risk to off-site receptors to be unacceptable and to represent a potential imminent health risk    The results of soil and groundwater investigation activities conducted in June 2000 and November 2004 at the Site identified halogenated solvents, specifically tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE), in soil and groundwater at the Site. Of particular concern, TCE was reported as present at maximum concentrations of 17 milligrams of analyte per kilogram of soil sample mass (mg\/kg) and 1,100,000 micro-grams of analyte per liter of aqueous sample (µg\/L). The extents and stability of soil, groundwater, and soil vapor PCE and TCE contamination have not yet been evaluated or defined. Evaluation of vapors at the Site has been limited to a single sampling event conducted in November of 2018. The November 2018 evaluation indicated that PCE was present in the sub-slab beneath the building at a maximum concentration of 2,000 micrograms per cubic meter(ug\/m3) and that TCE was present in the sub-slab at a maximum concentration of 390 ug\/m3. ACDEH notes that the maximum detection of TCE in the sub-slab is adjacent to the western bound of the Site which abuts single family residences.     Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has identified several land uses at the Site and the adjacent property to the south that are potential contributors to TCE contamination. Of particular interest is Oakland Short Run Tool and Die which has historically been associated with both the Site and adjacent property to the south.    The responsible party is currently recalcitrant due to non-payment of regulatory oversight fees. Past due regulatory oversight fees have been sent to collections by ACDEH. ACDEH understands from conversations with the RP.s previous consultants (Eras Environmental and Apex [e.g. the Source Group]) that both of these consultants have also referred the responsible party to collections for non-payment of past due invoices associated with environmental work at the Site. Due to refusal of the RP to issue payment on ACDEH's fund requests, the case is currently inactive pending receipt of funding from the RP or transfer of regulatory oversight to the regional water quality control board.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site is the location of a former trucking facility that operated five underground storage tanks (USTs) used for the storage of gasoline, diesel. fresh and spent motor oils, and a tank of unknown contents.  The five USTs were removed between March 1987 and October 2011.  Based on evidence a release occurred during removal of the first two tanks, an unauthorized release form was issued in May 1987 and an LOP case, RO0000039, opened.  Following tank removals, remediation, and monitoring, the LOP case was closed in July 2015 to the existing land use as a commercial (trucking) facility. This SCP case was opened in 2016 following a change in land use to residential.      An Underground Storage Tank Closure Report (USTR,) dated July 17, 2020, documented the removal of one UST from beneath the 17th Street sidewalk area adjacent to the subject case.    Laboratory analysis of the tank contents revealed the presence of several potential chemicals of concern (PCOCs) including total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline (TPHg) at 14 micrograms per liter (ug\/L), TPH as diesel (TPHd) at 21,000 ug\/L and acetone at 16 g\/L.   Following UST removal, additional soil from the base of the excavation was removed to a depth of approximately 11-feet below ground surface (approximately 2-feet below the base of the UST).      In early 2016, ACDEH was requested to review the now closed case file and to consider the site for unrestricted land use, as a residential development was being considered for the site.  A Voluntary Remedial Action Program (also known as Site Cleanup Program -SCP) case, RO0003206,  was open in June 2016.  Meetings including the landowner, consultant, and ACEH were held on May 6, 2016, June 8, 2016, and July 20, 2016 to refine the development plan and address potential data gaps.  At the July 20, 2016 meeting, ACDEH requested a toxicologist be contracted to evaluate the existing data for a determination if additional data is needed for preparation of a risk assessment.  Meetings have been routinely held to re view project development status and the path toward closure.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In 1932 and 1973 the site was used as a service station. The number of generations of petroleum underground storage tanks that have been installed at the site is unknown. Four 1,000-gallon fuel underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed in 1973 when the service station was decommissioned. Between 1999 and 2001, the dispenser island, sumps, the hydraulic hoist, building foundations, garbage enclosure, yard lights and asphalt were removed including an orphaned 1,000-gallon gasoline UST, an orphaned 550-gallon used-oil UST, and a buried 55-gallon drum (apparently a makeshift used-oil underground storage tank). In November of 2002 approximately 1,584 tons of hydrocarbon-impacted soil was excavated to approximately 12 to 14 feet below ground surface and transported to Allied Waste Landfill in Manteca, California from the areas of the former USTs, dispenser island, hydraulic lift, and sumps. While the excavation was open, 900 pounds of oxygen release compound was placed beneath the ground to provide oxygen to help degrade any residual petroleum hydrocarbon mass. There have been multiple investigations at the Site, which include installation of groundwater monitoring wells, surficial soil sampling, a remedial pilot test of groundwater cleanup technology (air sparging), and collection of soil vapor samples. In April 2019, sixty-nine (69) on-site borings were advanced with the continuous collection of soil samples and logged in 0.5-foot intervals to determine the present-day soil concentrations for lead-impacted soil on site. In June 2019, site soil was tested for treatment of lead using phosphate amendments, however, none of the phosphate reagents tested was successful in reducing the bio-accessibility of the lead in surface soils at the Site. To date, 18 groundwater monitoring wells, 8 air sparge wells, 76 exploratory borings, and 15 soil vapor probes have been installed, and numerous surface, near- surface, and deeper soil samples have been collected both on and near the site to characterize and monitor environmental conditions. Remedial action was implemented in 2021 consisting of 1) excavation of petroleum-contaminated soil to 15 feet below ground surface 2) placement of gypsum into the base of the excavations to reduce petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in on-site groundwater and soil within the saturated zone and 3) placement of clean backfill to the ground surface. The remedial action was completed in November 2021.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has been providing regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003259 since August 2017 subsequent to referral by the Responsible Party.  To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted between 2017 to 2021 to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to various commercial configurations such as automobile service and repair operations with associated former underground storage tanks (USTs), dispenser islands, waste oil USTs, and hydraulic hoists.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil, soil vapor, and groundwater).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include the hazardous material survey and abatement of the existing onsite building and hardscape; demolition of existing Site buildings and above ground infrastructure; remediation and\/or off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; enhanced in-situ bioremediation of groundwater; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.  Corrective actions are presently be implemented at the Site.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes construction of an eight-story mixed-use building with a subterranean parking garage that is proposed to cover nearly the entire footprint of the Site.  The building will consist of six stories of mixed commercial and residential aboveground and two stories subterranean used for parking.        The site is located in a mixed residential and commercial area of Oakland and consists of two parcels including Alameda County Assessor Parcel Number (APN) 12-986-25-1 located at 230 West MacArthur Boulevard and APN 12-986-28, located at 240 West MacArthur Boulevard.  APN 12 986-25-1 was developed as Shell Service Station with thee underground storage tanks (USTs), two dispenser islands, and a kiosk and operated as a fueling and auto service station since approximately the early 1950’s.  In 2019 and 2020 the former Shell station was decommissioned including the removal of all UST, demolition of onsite buildings and removal of subsurface infrastructure and UST system components in order to prepare this Site for redevelopment activities.  APN 12-986-28 was developed as an auto repair garage - Oakland AutoWorks (OAW) and has historically operated as Gulf Service Station which had three 10,000-gallon USTs (removed sometime prior to 1991) and one 350-gallon waste oil UST (removed in 1996).  Historical records indicate Gulf Service Station operated until the early 1950s.  In 2019 and 2020 OAW was decommissioned in order to prepare the Site for redevelopment activities including building demolition and removal of Site infrastructure including hydraulic hoists.    Two Leaking Underground Fuel Tank (LUFT) cases are associated with the two parcels including; LUFT Case No. RO0000303 and Case No. RO0000142, respectively.  Case No. RO0000303 is associated with APN 12-986-25-1 and was closed by ACDEH in January 2013. Case No. RO0000142 is associated with APN 12-986-28 and is an open fuel leak case.  The case was listed as inactive in December 2017 and investigation and cleanup is currently being conducted under Site Cleanup Program Case No0003259. Administrative closure of LUFT Case No. RO0000142 will be conducted upon completion of the redevelopment project and site investigation and remediation activities associated with the UST system related petroleum hydrocarbon contamination on APN 12 986 28.    Petroleum hydrocarbons and related fuel constituents and chlorinated solvents have been detected in soil, soil vapor, and groundwater on both parcels at concentrations above the 2019 San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Boards (State Water Board) Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs).  Environmental site investigations relating to the release of petroleum hydrocarbons and related fuel constituents from USTs began in 1986 at 230 West MacArthur Boulevard (APN 12 986-25-1) and in 1991 at 240 West MacArthur Boulevard (APN 12-986-28).     Chlorinated solvents were detected in soil, soil vapor, and groundwater during environmental investigations conducted in 2017 and 2018 in association with the proposed site redevelopment.  Due to non-UST potential chemicals of concern (PCOCs) detected in soil, soil vapor, and groundwater a Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0003259 was opened and site investigation activities are being conducted to further delineate the vertical and lateral extent of the chlorinated solvents in the subsurface on both properties and evaluate the associated risk to potential on- and off-site sensitive receptors.    Subsequent to site investigation activities conducted in 2017 and 2018, ACDEH approved an Remedial Action Plan (RAP) dated May 24, 2018 following the completed public notification process.  The RAP work scope included but was not limited to additional subsurface investigations and installation of soil vaporand groundwater monitoring probes\/wells, remedial excavation beneath the Site to 17 ft depth in conjunction with development plan, application of treated media to the excavation areas to enhance in-situ bioremediation of constituents of concern in groundwater or saturated soil and installation of Vapor Mitigation and Engineering Controls (VMECs).    Following submittal of the RAP, ACDEH rejected the August 6, 2019 Remedial Action Implementation Plan and the October 31, 2019 Revised Remedial Action Implementation Plan prepared by the responsible parties' former environmental consultant to facilitate implementation of the RAP. In an email dated November 14, 2019, ACDEH provided agency requirements, technical comments, and the requirement for additional assessment of petroleum hydrocarbons associated with the former UST operations on each of the two properties and chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCS), particularly tetrachloroethene [PCE]) found in site soil gas and groundwater.      In a meeting with ACDEH, the responsible party and their new environmental consultant on December 6, 2019,  verbal concurrence by ACDEH was granted to advance passive gas sampling followed by high-resolution site characterization data via the membrane-interface probe and hydraulic profiling tool (MIP-HPT). Results from these investigations are provided in the Additional Assessment Workplan dated January 13, 2020 and used to select appropriate sampling locations for soil and grab groundwater assessment.  A Work Plan for the evaluation of subsurface conditions from petroleum hydrocarbon impacts associated with the former UST operations on each of the two properties and chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCS, including but not limited to tetrachloroethene [PCE]) previously detected in soil gas and groundwater at the Site was conducted at the Site during January and February 2020.   Results of these subsurface investigations are presented in Section 4.0 of the Corrective Action Implementation Plan (CAIP), dated February 12, 2020.      In March 2020 ACDEH conditionally approved the CAIP which supports proposed corrective actions presented in the ACDEH-approved RAP dated May 24, 2018.  The scope of work for the CAIP details plans regarding corrective actions at the Site including; remedial excavation of soils from non-petroleum related PCE source material beneath the former OAW facility and residual hydrocarbon and lead source material that exceeds applicable regulatory environmental screening levels for construction workers; treatment of PCE in shallow (&lt;21 feet below ground surface; bgs) groundwater using treated media for enhanced in-situ bioremediation; treatment of PCE in deeper (22-26 feet bgs) groundwater using treated media for enhanced inset bioremediation or alternatively groundwater remediation in excavation cut-off trenches using treated media for either PCE for petroleum hydrocarbons; further evaluation of offsite subsurface conditions via advancement of offsite soil vapor and groundwater monitoring wells; installation of VMECs – including a vapor mitigation system beneath the entire proposed new building footprint to control potential vapor migration to indoor air, and installation of trench dams and\/or plugs along utility corridors to control vapor migration along preferential pathways; and implementation of institutional controls, including long-term maintenance of the vapor barrier and recordation of a land use covenant.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has been providing regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003363 since May 2019 subsequent to a property transaction.  To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as service stations and various car wash facilities with associated oil\/water separators, clarifier and drainage outlets.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil and soil vapor).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include remedial soil excavation and off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.  Proposed redevelopment plans are still being drafted, however, the developer plans on creating affordable and workforce rental housing in collaboration with the City of Oakland.          The subject site (the Site) is located at 8930 MacArthur Boulevard in a mixed-use commercial and residential area of the Castlemont neighborhood in Oakland.  The Site consists of one Alameda County assessor parcel number (APN) 43A-4638-42 and is roughly a rectangular shaped and measures approximately 0.2 acres or 8,606 square feet.  The Site is bound to the north by commercial buildings, to the east by residential single family homes, to the south by 90th Avenue and additional commercial, and to the west by MacArthur Boulevard and commercial structures.  Currently the property is vacant and consists of asphalt paving (lot line to lot line) and a rectangular concrete section is the center of the property which contains remnants of a clarifier and drainage outlets from previous operations as a former car wash facility.  A retaining wall was observed on the east side of the property.  Previous operations at the Site included undeveloped between approximately 1897 and 1923, two service stations between the 1948-1953 and 1961-1965,  reality company in 1969, commercial building and additional service stations between 1970 to early 1980, and more recently a car wash from 1980's to early 2000.",

Additionally, a heating oil tank (unknown if removed) was associated with the site prior to the current RP taking ownership in 1967. The site has been used for the repair of electrical motors and storage of associated parts since 1967. No releases are suspected since 1967 as the business used or stored no significant quantities of chemicals. Historical uses, including the use of Stoddard solvents at the known historical dry cleaner, and other suspected unknown commercial\/light industrial uses prior to 1967 are believed to be the sources of the impacts identified in 2019.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently a vacant lot located on the southwest corner of East 27th Street and 26th Avenue in Oakland, California.  Surrounding land use is residential.  Planned development for the site consists of two residential housing units.      A gasoline service station and repair garage operated at the site from 1927 through 1994.  On August 30 and 31, 1994, four 500-gallon gasoline USTs and one 100-galllon waste oil UST were removed.  Soil sample results from the bottom of the tank pit excavations contained TPH as gasoline at concentrations up to 930 ppm.  Petroleum hydrocarbons were not detected in soil samples collected beneath the former dispenser islands.  Upon completion of the soil sampling, the excavations were lined with plastic and backfilled with the stockpiled soil removed from the excavation.  According to the tank removal report, backfilling of the tank pit excavations with contaminated soil was meant as a temporary measure to protect the stability of excavation sidewalls and adjacent streets.  Re-excavation and off-site disposal of the contaminated backfill was recommended but not implemented until excavation in 2006.      Despite requests for work by ACEH, no investigation or remediation was conducted at the site between the tank removal in 1994 and the preparation of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in 2001.  Notices of Violation were issued on May 25, 1995 and May 13, 1996.  A Pre-Enforcement Review Hearing was held on September 4, 1996.  The case was referred to the Alameda County District Attorney’s office for enforcement on September 22, 1999.      On June 19, 2002 three soil borings (EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3) were advanced in each of the three former tank pits for soil and groundwater sampling.  The borings were converted into monitoring wells; however, the wells were destroyed after one sampling event.  TPHg was detected in soil from the two soil borings in the former gasoline tank pits at concentrations up to 1,800 ppm.  TPHg was detected in groundwater from one of the three wells (EB-2) at a concentration of 93 ppb.  TPHd was detected in groundwater from each of the three wells at concentrations ranging from 56 to 360 ppb.   Benzene was detected in one of three groundwater samples at a concentration of 0.97 ppb.  MTBE was not detected in any soil or groundwater samples.    In January 2005, ten soil borings (SB-1 through SB-10) were advanced at the site for collection of soil and groundwater samples.  The maximum concentrations of TPHg and TPHd detected in soil from the ten borings were 61 ppm and 52 ppm, respectively.  Grab groundwater samples collected from the borings contained up to 90,000 ppb of TPHg and 750,000 ppb of TPHd.  The maximum concentration of benzene detected in grab groundwater samples was 140 ppb.    In February 2006, an additional 14 soil borings (SB-11 through SB-24) were advanced both on-site and off-site.  Soil samples were collected at 2-foot intervals and a grab groundwater sample was collected from each soil boring.  The maximum concentrations of TPHg and TPHd detected in soil from the 14 borings were 250 ppm and 490 ppm, respectively.  TPHg was detected in 3 of the 14 grab groundwater samples at concentrations ranging from 51 to 1,500 ppb.  Benzene was not detected in any of the grab groundwater samples.  TPHd was detected in 9 of the 14 grab groundwater samples at concentrations ranging from 89 to 3,600 ppb.  TPH as motor oil was detected in 8 of the 14 grab groundwater samples at concentrations ranging from 310 to 28,000 ppb.     One soil boring (SB-25) was advanced to a depth of 27 feet bgs to collect depth-discrete grab groundwater samples to define the vertical extent of contamination on September 20, 2006.  Based on the results from SB-25, no further assessment of the vertical extent of contamination was proposed.    Approximately 396 tons of contaminated soil was excavated on December 1 and 2, 2006. The excavations were backfilled with clean, imported fill.  Attwo locations, the concentration of TPHg in sidewall confirmation soil samples exceeded the target cleanup level of 100 ppm.  Excavation was reportedly not continued at these two locations due to the proximity of the excavation to the sidewalk along East 27th Street and instability of the excavation walls.  In response to ACEH concerns regarding the extent and effectiveness of the excavation, eight soil borings (CS-1 through CS-8) were advanced outside the excavation walls to confirm the effectiveness of the soil removal.  TPHg, TPHd, and BTEX were not detected at concentrations exceeding reporting limits in soil samples from confirmation borings CS-1 through CS-8.      To assess the potential for vapor intrusion to indoor air, soil vapor samples were collected from six locations (SV-1 through SV-6), three from the footprint of each planned residence in February 2008.  Although petroleum hydrocarbons were not detected at concentrations exceeding screening levels, trichloroethene (TCE) was detected at a concentration of 5.7 micrograms per liter (µg\/L) in one soil vapor sample (SV-4).  In March 2010, soil vapor samples were collected from six locations (SV-8 through SV-13) adjacent to or surrounding SV-4.  TCE was not detected above a reporting limit of 0.1 µg\/L in any of the soil vapor samples collected in March 2010.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In January 2021, a UST fill port was discovered in the sidewalk east of the Site along Market Street during demolition activities for Site development. The UST was removed under oversight and a permit from the California Unified Program Agency (CUPA). Soil samples collected form the bottom and sidewalls of the UST pit indicated an unauthorized release of petroleum had occurred and Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) opened the LUST case. In January 2021 secondary source removal was conducted by over-excavating the tank pit to the maximum extent practicable prior to backfilling.    Based on an analysis of site-specific conditions, ACDEH has determined that under current and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios, the concentrations of petroleum constituents in soil, soil vapor, and groundwater from the UST system release pose a low threat to human health and safety and to the environment, and therefore, ACDEH is considering Case closure and has changed the status of the Case to “Eligible for Closure” on the State Water Resources Control Board’s GeoTracker website.    Prior to Case closure and the issuance of a Remedial Action Completion Certificate, ACDEH is required to initiate a sixty-day public comment period  from August 1, 2022 through September 30, 2022 on the proposed Case closure and consider any comments received before making a final determination on Case closure.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Mobil began operating a bulk fuel terminal at the site in 1928.  Refined petroleum products were mixed and stored in ASTs and USTs.  Products included gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, stove oil, weed oil, lubes.  The terminal was dismantled in 1979 and the site used as a cargo terminal.  Investigations indicate that the groundwater is impacted with free petroleum product.      Remedial activities, including vapor extraction and air sparging (VE\/AS), were conducted at the subject site between 2003 and 2018 to address petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in the subsurface. Limited remedial excavation activities were also completed between 2016 to 2017. As part of the curtailment activities, 36 AS wells were destroyed in July 2012 and 69 AS and nine VE wells were destroyed in December 2017. The VE\/AS operation was shut down on June 26, 2019, and rebound monitoring was performed. The results of the rebound monitoring indicated that remedial operations of the VE\/AS system were no longer needed.    65 air sparge (AS) wells at the subject property were destroyed by overdrilling and sealed by pressure grouting per a variance request approved by Alameda County Public Works Agency. The well boxes were filled with concrete to ground surface and refinished to match surrounding conditions. Curtailment activities at the Site will continue with the destruction of the remaining 95 AS wells. A Risk Management Plan will be implemented to eliminate future impacts to human health or water quality from site contamination.",

To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as churches and restaurants.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include the hazardous material survey and abatement of the existing onsite building and hardscape; demolition of existing Site buildings and above ground infrastructure; remediation and off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility or capping and consolidation under site hardscape.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes a 6-story 53-residential unit building with commercial and parking on the ground floor, additional parking and open scape on floor 2 and residential units on the upper four floors      The half-acre Site is currently occupied by Vegan Mob, a restaurant located at 500 Lake Park Avenue. The Site is in the Grand Lake Neighborhood, a mixed commercial and residential area, and near Interstate 580, City of Oakland parks (East Shore and Splash Pad) are located adjacent to the Site in northeast tip of Lake Merritt. The Site operated as residential use until approximately 1957 when the former building was demolished, and the current-day restaurant building was constructed along Lake Park Avenue. The northeast portion of the Site, located along Cheney Avenue, contained residential buildings and a church until 1968. Since then this portion of the Site has been used as a parking lot for the restaurant. No industrial activities are known to have occurred on the Site.    Environmental investigations were conducted in 2018 to assess the type and extent of contamination in fill, soil, and groundwater at the Site from historic land uses and aerial deposition from vehicle exhaust from Interstate 580. Lead has been detected in soil above applicable regulatory agency screening levels for residential land use in the portion of the Site located along Lake Shore Avenue. Diesel and motor oil range total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH-d and TPH-mo), acetone, and methyl ethyl ketone has also been detected in soil at concentrations that do not exceed applicable regulatory screening levels. TPH-d has been detected in groundwater at concentration below applicable regulatory screening levels.    Additional subsurface investigations will be conducted (Q2020) to assess the extent of elevated lead in soil. Soil samples will also be analyzed for asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), constituents typically associated with building materials and demolition before the 1980s. Sampling results from this subsurface investigation will guide corrective actions to address the elevated lead during Site construction.",

On October 19 and 20, 1995 two USTs (one-4,000-gallon gasoline and one 7,000-gallon diesel) were removed from the site.  Confirmation samples contained 64,000 mg\/kg TPHd (dispenser sample) and 560 mg\/kg TPHoil.  Tank pit water samples contained 170 µg\/L TPHoil and 2,000 µg\/L TPHd.  No benzene was detected in any sample.  MTBE was detected in the water sample collected from the gasoline UST excavation at a concentration of 260 µg\/L.  The pea gravel was sampled and reused.  A small portion of soil (20.6 tons) was removed from the site.        Two soil borings were advanced downgradient of the USTs on February 8, 1996.  Soil samples contained 1,200 mg\/kg TPHoil in TW-1 and groundwater samples contained 2,300,000 µg\/L TPHoil from TW-2.  TPHd was not detected with a reporting limit of 62,500 µg\/L.  TW-2 is located at a freeway column for Highway 580.      On July 29, 1997, six borings were advanced four of which were converted to monitoring wells.  Total oil and grease was detected in soil at a maximum concentration of 5,200 mg\/kg.  Tetrachloroethene was detected at 0.03 mg\/kg in sample B4-5 and 0.025 mg\/kg 1,2,4 trimethylbenzene and 0.0078 mg\/kg 1,3,5 trimethylbenzene were detected in B4-10.  No other VOCs were detected in soil.  Benzene was detected in a groundwater sample from MW-1 at a concentration of 1.1 µg\/L.  No TPHg, TPHd, TOG, MTBE or other VOCs were detected.  Subsequent groundwater monitoring occurred for a total of 3 quarters.  MTBE was detected at 95 ppb, no other constituents were detected in the wells.  Well MW-2 was located less than 15 feet in the downgradient direction from TW-2.  Groundwater samples from this well were below the detection limit for TPHg, TPHd, BTEX, MTBE indicating that the contamination is not laterally extensive.      The monitoring wells were last sampled March 13, 1998 and shortly afterward destroyed.  No monitoring well destruction report was provided at the time of decommissioning.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Leona Heights Sulfur Mine is a small, inoperative pyrite mine located in the Oakland Hills. Acid mine drainage occurred as water came into contact mining wastes piled on the surface. Rain water and water from Leona Creek, which runs through the site, became acidified by the sulfur in the tailings, leaching metals into the creek.  The pH range of Leona Creek ranged from 5 in the dry season to 1.5 in the wet season. The acid leached metals from surrounding soils and sediments, such that concentrations of metals and arsenic were 10 to 10,000 times water quality objectives intended to protect aquatic species.     Soil at the site  was contaminated by the mining, and potentially the processing, of pyrite ore on site conducted by various mine owners and operators who are no longer viable entities. These operations resulted in contamination of soil and surface water with low pH and arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, zinc, and mercury, which constitute hazardous materials as that term is defined in Health &amp; Safety Code Section 25260.     The site was remediated by isolating the mining waste from water to preclude the production of acid. This consisted of constructing three slopes of mining waste against the native hillside of the canyon.  The slopes were stabilized  and covered with an impermeable HDPE liner. The liner was covered with topsoil, erosion control mats were installed, and the slopes have been hydroseeded with native grasses. Mining wastes were removed from the creek bed and Leona Creek was reconstructed.  This included the construction of drop structures reminiscent of natural creek designs on steep slopes, like step-pools.    Construction of the design remediation is complete and the project is now in the monitoring and maintenance phase; a monitoring and maintenance plan is in development.  The site will be monitored and maintained under Water Board guidance.  To ensure the remedy is stable and effective, the Water Board is requiring monitoring of the slopes and creek for stability and native vegetation coverage, including visual inspections and surveys. Repairs and maintenance will be conducted as needed.  Leona Creek water quality will be monitored as well. Iron-hydroxide precipitates (which cause the orange color in the creek bed) are still intermittently produced. This condition is being evaluated to determine if it is natural (due to pyrite containing Leona Rhyolite bedrock native to the area) or a result of mining. If the latter, further remedial measures may be necessary.     Inspections after large earthquakes and rain events that have the potential to damage the remedy have also been required.  A deed restriction was record to require Water Board notification and approval for projects that could impact the waste or remedy.",

The property is located in a mixed commercial and residential area of Oakland and is bordered to the south by Yerba Buena Avenue, residential properties to the east, commercial and residential properties to the west, and 40th Street to the north.  Soil on the site generally consists of clays, with occasional interbedded silts, sands, and gravel.  Stabilized groundwater is generally at depths between 5 and 10 feet below ground surface (fbgs).   Groundwater appears to have been encountered initially at depths ranging from 12 to 16 fbgs, but this is not specifically reported.  Groundwater monitoring has been conducted at the site from March 19, 1997 to December 29, 2011.  Contamination on the site is highest in the southeast portion of the site in areas west, northwest, and around the former underground storage tanks (USTs).    On December 19, 1995, one 1,000-gallon diesel UST and one 500- or 800-gallon gasoline UST were removed from the southeastern area of the property.  Three discrete soil samples and one soil stockpile sample were collected.  Soil samples collected beneath the 1,000-gallon diesel UST contained up to 8.7 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), 29 mg\/kg Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), and 29 mg\/kg Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), and 0.77 mg\/kg benzene.  Soil samples collected from beneath the 500-gallon UST gasoline contained 100 mg\/kg TPHg, 96 mg\/kg TPHd, 2.3 mg\/kg benzene, and 1.4 mg\/kg MTBE (benzene is not reported).  The soil stockpile sample contained 580 mg\/kg TPHg, 120 mg\/kg TPHd, and 42 mg\/kg lead.  Groundwater was not encountered in the excavation.  Holes and corrosion were noted on all portions of the USTs, but the locations were not specifically defined.    On September 12, 1996, four soil borings (SB-1 through SB-4) were advanced near the former UST excavation.  Soil samples were collected every five feet; only the samples collected at ten fbgs were analyzed.  The soil sample collected from boring SB-1 at ten fbgs contained the highest concentrations including up to 290 mg\/kg TPHg, 45 mg\/kg TPHd, 3.9 mg\/kg benzene, and 1.5 mg\/kg MTBE.  Groundwater was encountered at approximately 13-15 fbgs and grab groundwater samples were collected from bores SB-2 and SB-4.  Concentrations in the grab groundwater samples contained up to 5,500 micrograms per liter (µg\/l) TPHg, 2,100 µg\/l TPHd, 340 µg\/l benzene, and 230 µg\/l MTBE.  The tank removal excavation pit remained open and a four-point composite soil sample was collected from the stockpiled soil generated during this event.  Two soil samples were additionally collected from the southern wall of the open excavation.    On October 25, 1996, the tank removal excavation was overexcavated laterally seven feet to the south and 12 feet to the west.  Three sidewall and three four-point composite stockpile soil samples were collected during the excavation activities.  The sidewall sample collected from the west wall of the excavation contained the greatest concentration; with 150 mg\/kg TPHg, 300 mg\/kg TPHd, and 16 mg\/kg benzene (MTBE was not analyzed in these samples).  The greatest contaminant concentrations in the four-point stockpile samples were 850 mg\/kg TPHg, 720 mg\/kg TPHd, and 1.3 mg\/kg benzene.  In November 1996, 235 tons of contaminated soil was disposed of at the BFI Vasco Road Sanitary Landfill in Livermore, CA.    On March 6, 1997 three borings (BH-1 through BH-3) were advanced and converted to monitoring wells (MW-1 to MW-3).  Soil samples collected from 10 fbgs were analyzed for contamination.  Groundwater samples were collected from the wells on March 13, 1997.  The soil sample collected from BH-3 (MW-3) contained the greatest TPHg and benzene concentrations of 110 mg\/kg and 1.1 mg\/kg, respectively.  The soil samples collected from BH-2 (MW-2) contained the greatest TPHd concentration of 18 mg\/kg.  No MTBE was detected in the soil samples.  The groundwater sample collected from MW-3 was the only sample with detectable concentrations of constituents other than MTBE.  Groundwater from MW-3 contained 26,000 µg\/l TPHg, 5,000 µg\/l TPHd and 3,000 µg\/l benzene.  MTBE was detected in MW-1, MW-2, and MW-3 groundwater samples at concentrations of 23, 65, and 230 µg\/l, respectively.  The static groundwater depth was measured between 7.59 and 8.25 fbgs.  To assess lateral extent of impacted groundwater, six soil borings (SB-1 through SB-6) were drilled south and west of existing well locations on November 4, 1998.  The borings were advanced to depths between 15 and 20 fbgs and groundwater was encountered between 12 and 15 fbgs. Soil samples were collected; however, all samples were placed on hold at the laboratory and were not analyzed.  In groundwater, TPHd was only detected in upgradient bore SB-1 at a concentration of 2,400 µg\/l.  Toluene was the only other detected constituent and was found in SB-6 at a concentration of 0.6 µg\/l.    Based on the November 4, 1998 boring results monitoring well MW-4 was requested to be installed upgradient (south) of the former tank locations on July 15, 1999.  Two soil samples were collected at 10 and 14 fbgs from the boring.  No detectable concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were found in the soil samples.  Well MW-4 was sampled during the next groundwater monitoring event on August 5, 1999.  MTBE was the only detectable constituent in well MW-4 in that sampling event; at a concentration of 37 µg\/l.  Groundwater sampled from well MW-3 during the same event contained the highest groundwater concentrations; with 5,100 µg\/l TPHd, 31,000 µg\/l TPHg and 5,400 µg\/l benzene detected.  The MW-2 groundwater sample contained 600 µg\/l MTBE.  A Corrective Action Plan (CAP) was submitted on July 31, 2001 which evaluated a number of remedial technologies, recommended vapor extraction \/ air sparging, and proposed that a pilot test of the technology be conducted.  The need for the pilot test was accepted in a December 2001 directive letter; however, the proposed remedial cleanup goals were not.    On May 6, 2004, soil borings AS-1, AS-2, and SVE-1 were completed as two 30 fbgs air sparge wells and one ten fbgs soil vapor extraction well, respectively.  Additionally, six shallow vapor points (DP-1 through DP-6) were installed to a depth of 15.5 fbgs on May 12 and 13, 2004.   The purpose of the May 6, 2004 well installation was to determine the potential for air sparge\/soil vapor extraction (AS\/SVE) remediation.  Soil samples were collected at approximately five foot intervals from the soil borings.  Grab groundwater samples were collected on May 24, 2004 from bores DP-1, DP-2, and DP-3, and groundwater was collected from well MW-3.  All contaminant concentrations, with the exception of MTBE, were greatest in shallow vapor point DP-5, located at the edge, but within the area of overexcavation, 15 feet southwest of the former UST area.  Soil concentrations, at a depth of 11.5 fbgs, in DP-5 were 2,900 mg\/kg TPHg, 830 mg\/kg TPHd, 0.012 mg\/kg benzene, and &lt;10 mg\/kg MTBE.  The highest MTBE soil concentration was 0.049 mg\/kg, detected in well AS-1 which was located approximately 15 feet west of the former overexcavated UST area.  Groundwater samples collected during the event contained up to 90,000 µg\/l TPHg, 26,000 µg\/l TPHd, 6,700 µg\/l benzene, and &lt;1,200 µg\/l MTBE in MW-3.  Preliminary tests of the AS\/SVE pilot test were conducted during May and June, 2004.  Air samples collected during AS\/SVE operation contained up to 150,000 micrograms per liter (µg\/L) TPHg (150,000,000 micrograms per cubic meter [µg\/m3]), 1,800 µg\/L (1,800,000 µg\/m3) benzene, and 1,400 µg\/L (1,400,000 µg\/m3) MTBE.  Based on the results a combined bio-sparge and SVE remediation system was recommended.    After the AS\/SVE pilot test light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) was observed in MW-3 from September 2004 to March 2006.  The LNAPL was requested to be removed prior to any corrective action measures.  Three mobile LNAPL extraction events were conducted between September and November 2004; 245 gallons of LNAPL and groundwater were extracted and LNAPL thickness was reduced from 0.66 to 0.05 feet.    Due to the low permeability of soils, AS\/SVE remediation was deemed to be less effective than high vacuum dual phase extraction (HVDPE).  Consequently a 5-day HVDPE extraction event was conducted after receipt of permits from EBMUD and the BAAQMD by Cal-Clean between March 8 and March 13, 2006.  Approximately 4,900 gallons of groundwater was extracted and discharged to the sanitary sewer collection system.  The estimated hydrocarbon recovery from this event was 58.4 lbs., with calculated 1,763 lbs. remaining in the smear zone soils.    On December 14, 2006 wells MW-5 and MW-6 were installed to delineate the lateral and downgradient extent of the MTBE plume.  Soil samples were collected at approximately 10 and 16 fbgs in each soil bore; groundwater stabilized at 16 and 8 fbgs, respectively.  All concentrations in soil (TPHg, TPHd, BTEX, and MTBE) were non-detectable at standard reporting limits.  Subsequently a LNAPL recovery system was proposed in March 2007 work plan, and consisted of a passive Keck skimmer device.    After a change in consultants a change in the remedial approach was proposed in an April 2007 work plan.  The work plan proposed excavation in the vicinity of the former fuel dispenser and LNAPL containing well MW-3 and the implementation of an ozone injection pilot test.  A work plan addendum was requested and an addendum included the installation of four soil bores to characterize residual hydrocarbon concentrations associated with the excavation backfill, and beneath the depth of the excavation.    On November 23, 2007, wells DP-3, DP-4, DP-5, DP-6, AS-1, AS-2, and MW-3 were decommissioned by pressure grouting.  On November 27, 2007, soil borings B-1 to B-4 were installed to vertically characterize residual concentrations associated with the backfilled UST excavation.  Existing reports indicated the excavations were backfilled with uncharacterized cleaner tank excavation spoils below clean fill, while the vertical extent previously had not been determined.  The bores were installed to depths ranging from approximately 16 to 30 fbgs in the source zone.  Soil and grab groundwater samples were collected from each boring.  The highest concentration of TPHd in soil and groundwater was detected in boring B-3 at eight fbgs at 410 mg\/kg and 750 µg\/l, respectively.  The highest concentration of TPHg in soil and groundwater was detected in boring B-2 at eight fbgs at a concentration of 170 mg\/kg and 320 µg\/l, respectively.  Boring B-2 also contained the highest concentration of MTBE in soil (at 12 fbgs) and groundwater, at concentrations of 6.5 mg\/kg and with 180 µg\/l, respectively.    Remedial excavation activities were conducted between March 10 and 12, 2008 immediately north of the Yerba Buena Avenue entrance to the site.   The excavation measured approximately 25 by 55 feet and extended to an approximate depth of 12 fbgs.  Of the total volume of soil excavated, a total of 282 tons of soil was segregated and disposed of offsite.  After completion of excavation activities on March 12, 2007, groundwater was periodically removed from the excavation cavity after allowing it to recharge.  A total of 2,500 gallons of hydrocarbon impacted groundwater was extracted over approximately a one week period.  One grab groundwater sample (VH-2) was collected from the holding tank containing the extracted recharge water.  Nine sidewall soil samples (SW-1 through SW-9) and six pit bottom soil samples (EB-1 through EB-6) were collected from the excavation pit on March 18, 2008.  The highest sidewall soil concentrations were collected from the southern wall of the excavation at with 73 mg\/kg TPHg, 63 mg\/kg TPHd, and 0.003 mg\/kg benzene; no MTBE was detected at standard reporting limits.  The highest excavation bottom sample concentrations were 170 mg\/kg TPHg, 7.4 mg\/kg TPHd, 0.012 mg\/kg benzene; no MTBE was detected at standard limits of reporting.  Additionally, sixteen discrete soil samples (SP-1 through SP-16) were collected from soil stockpiles generated during the excavation that were designated as clean backfill for the excavation pit.  Only one soil stockpile sample contained detectable amounts of contaminants, with concentrations of 1.5 mg\/kg TPHg and 0.043 mg\/kg xylenes.  The grab groundwater sample collected from the holding tank contained 100 µg\/l TPHg, 440 µg\/l TPHd, and 8.0 µg\/l xylenes.  The interim remedial action report recommended case closure exclusively based on the residual concentrations in soil in the vicinity of the excavation.  As a result of the interim remedial excavation ACEH requested that post-excavation groundwater monitoring occur prior to implementation of the ozone injection pilot test, requested soil vapor sampling due to documented benzene concentrations in soil and groundwater, and requested that the extent of the MTBE plume be delineated.    Between April 7 and 11, 2011, groundwater monitoring well MW-7 and borings GA-1 through GA-8 were drilled and installed.  Soil and grab groundwater samples were collected from each boring.  Three soil gas samples (SG\/VS-1 through SG\/VS-3) were collected from vapor wells adjacent to the building in the eastern portion of the site.  Well MW-7 was installed in a submerged condition with the top of the screen approximately six feet below first encountered groundwater; consequently the well does not monitor the groundwater surface but a position below the groundwater surface.  The soil sample collected from boring GA-4, advanced in the location of the former USTs, at 19.5 fbgs was the only sample to contain constituents other than MTBE.  Soil sample GA-4 contained 7.9 mg\/kg TPHg, 0.13 mg\/kg benzene, and 2.5 mg\/kg tert-butyl alcohol (TBA).  MTBE was detected in soil from borings GA-1 through GA-4, with the highest concentration detected of 0.89 mg\/kg, collected from GA-4.  Grab groundwater samples collected from borings GA-2 and GA-4, located closest but downgradient of, the former UST location and the March 2008 excavation area, contained the highest contaminant concentrations.  The highest detected concentrations in grab groundwater were 250 µg\/l TPHg, 100 µg\/l benzene, and 1,600 µg\/l MTBE.  MTBE was detected in all groundwater samples except those from downgradient borings GA-7 and GA-8.    Soil vapor samples collected May 5, June 10, and September 28, 2011 contained concentrations of leak check compounds of up to 28,000 µg\/m3 1,1-Diflouroethane (1,1-DFA), 34,000 µg\/m3 1,1-DFA, and 1,800 µg\/m3 Isopropyl Alcohol  (IP), respectively.  Because the shroud concentrations of 1,1-DFA were not collected, an estimate of the leak rate cannot be made.  While the IP tracer was present in the September 2011 sampling results, shroud concentrations were significantly higher (57,000 µg\/m3 IP).  This represents a concentration of 3.16% of the shroud concentration, and is not expected to significantly affect the results.  Soil vapor samples collected using the IP tracer documented vapor concentrations of up to &lt;160 µg\/m3 benzene, 26 µg\/m3 toluene, 6.3 µg\/m3 ethylbenzene, and 37.7 µg\/m3 xylenes; each is less than their respective soil gas vapor intrusion ESL.

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at https:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The site as currently developed is an eight story residential building consisting of six levels of condominiums comprising 101 units over two levels of above-grade parking.  At the time the case was opened in 2005,  the site consisted of a warehouse structure occupied by a plumbing supply company having an 1,000-gallon underground fuel storage tank (UST) located in the southwest corner of the property.  The UST was reported to have been last used sometime before 1978.  This site is the location of a former fuel leak case, Meyer Plumbing Supply, having the case number STID #4616.  The case was closed to commercial land use on June 18, 1996 with conditions including site re-evaluation should the property change in land use.  This case was opened as the result of the land use change from commercial to residential.      Prior to redevelopment to residential land use, the 1,000-gallon fuel UST was removed in October 2007.  Stained and odiferous soil was encountered at the time of the removal.  The tank pit was over excavated.  Impacts at the site were reported to include 5,300 mg\/kg TPHg, 15,000 mg\/kg TPHd and 1,200  mg\/kg lead.  VOCs are also reported at the site.    Grab groundwater was reported to include up to 5,400 ug\/L TPHg, 11,000 ug\/L TPHd, 2.4 ug\/L PCE, 1.3 ug\/L TCE and 1.1 ug\/L MTBE.",

In June 2003, 46 soil samples were collected from 23 borings and analyzed for lead, arsenic, pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Two samples collected near the former cooling tower were analyzed for total and hexavelent chromium. Lead, arsenic, and dieldrin were detected in shallow soil samples in concentratons in excess of Commercial ESLs.     In May 2005, impacted soil in eight areas was excavated and disposed of off-site. Arsenic was detected in soil confirmation samples in excess of the commercial ESLs. The excavation was backfilled with approximatley 162 tons of clean material - Alameda County Environmental Health agreed to closing the excavations without attainment of the proposed remedial goals on the condition that site usage does not change; and if site usage did change, the occurrence of arsenic in the soil would need to be reassessed. The site is currently fenced with no public access and changes in property usage are not planned in the near future.",

Underground storage tanks (USTs) were reported to have been installed in the western portion of the site in 1962, when the site was first occupied by a fuel service station.  A restaurant (Biff's Coffee and JJ's Diner) was constructed on the eastern portion of the property sometime between 1958 and 1968.  In 1998, the fuel service station was demolished, the USTs were removed, and the site was paved.  The paved lot was occupied by Audi of Oakland car sales facility and a vacant, circular building (the former restaurant) until the site was redeveloped in to the Oakland Broadway Uptown Venture property.",

The Phase I includes documentation indicating the Stop and Go station had three gasoline USTs, however the location, number, and contents of the Gulf Oil USTs is undocumented.  In January 2012 seven direct-push soil borings were drilled onsite. Concentrations of up to 110 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as Gasoline (TPHg), 1,500 mg\/kg TPH as diesel, and 4,500 mg\/kg TPH as motor oil were documented in soil samples. Concentrations of up to 150 micrograms per liter (ug\/l) TPH diesel and 370 ug\/l TPH motor oil were documented in grab groundwater samples. These data indicate that an unauthorized release from the underground storage tanks (USTs) had occurred at the site and this Leaking Underground Fuel Tank (LUFT) case was opened to investigate the release.    Environmental investigations were conducted in 2015 and 2018. The current property owner intends to redevelop the site into multi-unit residential housing.  A Request for Closure was denied by ACDEH because the case does not meet the LTCP Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater, General Criteria b (Petroleum-only Release), General Criteria d (Free Product), General Criteria e (Conceptual Site Model), or General Criteria f (Secondary Source Removal). Arroyo Viejo Creek, the closest surface water body, is located five feet from the southern corner of the site and is a perennial creek. Indirect evidence of NAPL was detected in two soil borings, GP-5 and B-3, located within 33 feet and 20 feet, respectively, from the Creek.  Consequently, the extent of the contaminant plume has not been adequately defined. The location, number, and contents of the two generations of USTs is undocumented. Therefore, at this juncture ACEH has requested that the RPs prepare a Data Gap Investigation Work Plan that is supported by a Site Conceptual Model (SCM).    A conference call held 10\/10\/2019 did not yield a cooperative effort, consequently, ACDEH is offering a final opportunity to the named RPs to work cooperatively to implement the requested work by the dates identified in the 10\/14\/2019 Directive Letter; if the requested documents are not submitted below, ACDEH will issue a Notice of Violation followed by a referral to the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office for enforcement.",

The material smelled of sulfur and was heterogenous in size from fine to gravel, and in areas the slope covered with a white and yellow crust indicative of sulfate salts. There was no evident bedrock, save for large boulders that appeared intentionally placed at the toe of the slope for stability.  A concrete plug was identified approximately 5 feet above the toe of the slope suggesting a closed adit.      Runoff from the slope stained concrete and asphalt orange and an XRF measurement of the material was high in sulfur (6,704+\/-316 mg\/kg). This runoff discharged to a children's park and to the storm drain, which discharges to surface water more than one thousand feet downstream (according to maps supplied by the Cit of Oakland), suggesting the site does not pose a water quality threat, but the potential threat to users of the park is appropriate.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Kaiser Permanente Medical Office Building (MOB) and parking structure is located at 3701-3799 Broadway Avenue in Oakland, California (the Site).  The MOB as a whole encompasses the city block fronting Broadway between Macarthur Boulevard to the south and 38th Street to the north.  The MOB is located on the southern portion of the block, and a parking structure is located on the northern end of the block.  The Site is bounded to the east by Broadway; to the south by Macarthur Boulevard; to the west by Western Creek, a single-family residence, vacant residences and Manila Street; and to the north by 38th Street.  The southern MOB was excavated to a depth of approximately 15 feet below grade surface (bgs), and the parking structure was excavated to a depth of approximately 30 feet bgs.    The property located at 3701 Broadway (corner of Broadway and Macarthur Boulevard) was occupied by a Chevron gasoline service station from approximately 1924 to 1988.  Although the former Chevron site is a part of the current MOB and parking structure, the property is NOT included in this closure package.  This division is observed due to a separation by case numbers.  The property located at 3735-3737 Broadway was formerly occupied by a car washing facility, which previously contained three 10,000-gallon underground storage tanks (USTs) and an aboveground sump used to contain rinsate from washing operations.  These USTs were removed in February 1987.  This property, as well as the properties located at 3741 Broadway and 3751-3757 Broadway, were most recently occupied by Honda of Oakland and operated as a new car dealership and automotive repair facility.  Historical documentation indicates that the properties at 3741 and 3751-3757 Broadway had been used as an automotive service facility since at least the 1920s.  The property located at 3781 Broadway was previously used as office space by Applied Research.  The building located at 3785 Broadway was occupied by a Firestone automotive service and repair facility, and the building at 3793 Broadway was most recently a pet boarding facility.  The property at 3799 previously operated as a Midas automotive service and repair facility.    As the parcels were purchased and were assembled together into the current configuration, the sites were investigated both separately and as a whole.  Data contained in the tables and depicted in the figures includes data from all of the sites, including the Chevron site, which is not a part of this closure.  The figures and data included in this package should be consulted to determine to which parcel they apply to (specifically Chevron and non-Chevron); there is some overlap.    Initial (non-Chevron parcel) investigations began in January 2004 with the installation of soil bores SB-1 to SB-12 (soil bores SB-1 to SB-3 were installed on the former Chevron parcel.)  This investigation included the collection of soil vapor data from selected soil bores (SB2-V, SB5-V, and SV7-V).  An additional soil bore investigation was conducted in January 2006 when soil bores SB-13 to SB-50 were installed over a period of several weeks (soil bores SB-13 to SB-30 were installed on the former Chevron parcel.)  Soil bores SB-51 to SB-76 were installed in September 2006.  All were installed on non-Chevron parcels.  (Additional concurrent investigations were occurring on the former Chevron parcel including: soil bores CSB-1 to CSB-22 installed in June 2006; and sixteen sidewall soil bores [as an alternative to sidewall sampling] installed in June 2006 [SWW-1 to SWW-3, SWW-5; SWS-1 to SWS-7; SWE-1 to SWE-5].  These data are not included in this closure package.)  Remediation activities were conducted on the Site between April and September 2007.  The site was broken in to seven Areas of Concern (AOC).  AOC 1 was the former Chevron parcel and is not further considered in this closure package.  AOC 2 and AOC 7 were located within the area excavated to 15 ft bgs for the MOB.  AOC 3, AOC4, AOC 5 and AOC 6 were located in the area excavated to a depth of 30 feet bgs for the parking structure.  Confirmation soil data for Areas 2 through 7 were compared to residential ESLs established by the RWQCB.  Residential soil ESLs were used as remediation goals.  Soils with constituents above the residential ESL target concentrations, but below hazardous waste limits specified by the landfill, were transported to Altamont Landfill in Alameda County, a Class II disposal facility.  No soil was disposed of at a hazardous waste (Class I) landfill.  Soil from AOC 1 (Chevron) was profiled and disposed of at an off-site facility under the direction of Chevron.    There was one 35 foot deep piezometer known to have been installed at the Kaiser Hospital at 280 W. MacArthur in June 1991.  One 37 foot well \/ piezometer was destroyed on July 20, 2007.  It is not certain that these are the same construct.    Confirmation soil samples were generally collected following removal of impacted soils.  For AOCs 2 to 7 confirmation soil samples were collected to document the removal of soils with concentrations of constituents above the residential ESL levels.  If confirmation soil samples did not meet ESL levels, the excavation was extended.  Soil handling and disposal was conducted in general accordance with the Soil Management Plan (SMP) and SMP Addendum prepared for the Site.    At 3735 – 3757 Broadway (AOC 2, AOC 3, AOC 4, and AOC 7) concentrations up to 690 mg\/kg TPHg, 77 mg\/kg TPHd, 95 mg\/kg TPHmo, 7.4 mg\/kg naphthalene, and 190 mg\/kg lead were detected in soil.  Remediation excavation confirmation soil samples for these AOC’s indicate residual concentrations were present at concentrations up to 7.2 mg\/kg TPHg, 100 mg\/kg TPHd, 120 mg\/kg TPHmo, and 23 mg\/kg lead.  It should be noted that this area was generally excavated an additional 5 feet below the depth of the remedial excavation (15 feet bgs total depth); however, confirmation samples were not collected.  Soil bore SB-52 was located inside the area of excavation for AOC 2 and documented residual concentrations up to 180 mg\/kg TPHg, 4 mg\/kg total xylenes, and 1.3 mg\/kg naphthalene at a depth of 20 feet bgs (up to 5 feet below the bottom of the MOB excavation); however, this may also have been partly removed at the time of the remediation excavation when a portion of the excavation was extended to a depth of 18 feet bgs in the immediate vicinity of B-52.  At 3785 Broadway (AOC 6) concentrations up to 72 mg\/kg TPHd, 350 mg\/kg TPHmo, 44 mg\/kg TPHhf, and 350 mg\/kg lead were detected in soil.  Remediation excavation confirmation soil samples for AOC 6 indicate residual concentrations up to 17 mg\/kg lead were present.  It should be noted that this area was excavated an additional 20 feet (30 feet bgs final depth).  At 3799 Broadway (AOC 5) concentrations up to 4,700 mg\/kg TPHd, 16,000 mg\/kg TPHmo, and 17,000 mg\/kg TPH hydraulic fluid (TPHhf) were detected.  Remediation excavation confirmation soil samples for AOC 5 indicate residual concentrations were present at concentrations up to 8.6 mg\/kg TPHd and 19 mg\/kg TPHhf.  It should be noted that this area was excavated an additional 10 feet (30 feet bgs final depth).    During site excavation an unknown 500-gallon waste oil UST was discovered, removed, and contaminated soil overexcavated.  It was located northeast of AOC 7 immediately east of Western Creek at 3735 – 3757 Broadway.  Concentrations up to 2,100 mg\/kg TPHg, 5,400 mg\/kg TPHd, 27,000 mg\/kg Oil and Grease, 5.0 mg\/kg toluene, and 150 mg\/kg lead were documented.  The remediation excavation confirmation soil samples (collected at an approximate depth of 15 feet bgs) indicated residual concentrations up to 520 mg\/kg TPHd, 900 mg\/kg Oil and Grease, and 120 mg\/kg lead were present.  However, according to relevant development plan details provided by Kaiser – Permanente, it appears that this area was subexcavated an additional 4.0 to 4.3 feet to construct the delivery area pavement section along the western edge of the MOB.  Additional charges for the removal of contaminated soil were also documented.  No further confirmation soil samples appear to have been collected.    Approximately 490 cubic yards of soil was removed from AOC 2; 280 cubic yards from AOC 3; 75 cubic yards from AOC 4; 2,000 cubic yards from AOC 5; 100 cubic yards from AOC 6; and 85 cubic yards from AOC 7.  A total of 3,764 tons (excluding AOC 1) of soil with concentrations greater than the residential ESL of petroleum hydrocarbons and\/or metals were transported to the Altamont landfill for disposal.    Construction dewatering of groundwater was managed by the installation and operation of an on-site dewatering and treatment system.  Groundwater was initially discharged to the sanitary sewer beginning on May 7, 2007, under East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) permit number 5061528-1.  A National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit (No. CAG912002 - Fuels General Permit) dated October 4, 2007, was obtained from the California RWQCB.  Prior to discharge under the NPDES permit, an influent and effluent sample was collected from the system per NPDES permit start-up requirements.  Discharge of the treated groundwater was routed to Western Creek under the NPDES permit beginning on October 12, 2007, and was discontinued on May 19, 2008.  The system was decommissioned on June 26, 2008 and had extracted a total of approximately 7,640,050 gallons of groundwater and treated approximately 2.10 pounds of hydrocarbons.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.

The Army Reserve had requested DTSC to continue subsequent cleanup activities under a new project “Oakland Army Reserve Exchange” with a different funding source. Please go to “Oakland Army Reserve Exchange” for further project status. (Geotracker case # T10000001240)    PROJECT INFORMATION:    OAB Heroic War Dead USAR, also known as the United States Army Reserve Center, is located near the eastern terminus of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Installation Restoration (IR) Site 1 is located at the northwestern portion of the USAR Center. The site consists of a wash rack (WR) which is a concrete pad, a below-grade oil water separator (OWS), and the surrounding soil. The WR\/OWS is approximately 15-feet by 20-feet in dimension. The site immediately surrounding the WR\/OWS is unpaved and covered with soil and gravel. The previous owner, Oakland Army Base, formerly used IR Site 1 to wash vehicles and engine components.     Operations ceased sometime prior to the USAR occupying the property in early 1970s. The USAR did not know of the existence of the WR\/OWS until they were uncovered in 1994 during a grading operation. The area has since been fenced to prevent unauthorized use. Investigations reveal that the soil contains concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons, metals, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) above regulatory guidelines.     DTSC had approved a Removal Action Workplan for the impacted soil and WR\/OWS, and accepted the Removal Action Report. The Army Reserve also monitored the groundwater quality and prepared a Remedial Investigation Report.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The prior diesel release in the Trailer on Flat Car (TOFC) within Berth 57 has been remediated by extraction wells that have significantly reduced the size of the diesel spill.   Dissolved diesel in groundwater downgradient from the release area has been well below the Water Board's environmental screening levels (ESLs) for aquatic impacts for the last several years.    In year 2000, the Port installed as part of their Vision 2000 program:  - Engineered concrete cap with an effective thickness of 6 feet over and beyond the TOFC area.   - Cement deep soil mixing (CDSM) wall with a width of 30 feet along the edge of the Oakland Inner Harbor as a geotechnical stabilization structure.    - Slurry wall north of the CDSM wall.  The concrete cap effectively isolates the diesel and other subsurface contaminants from potential human exposure and has decreased the rate of groundwater flow towards the Oakland Inner Harbor. The CDSM wall has a  very low permeability that effectively isolates the PCE area around well UO1-8 from the Oakland Inner Harbor.  Along with the slurry wall, the CDSM also effectively isolates the diesel area from the Oakland Inner Harbor.  Given the thorough isolationbehind the CDSM and slurry walls, diesel plume shrinkage and stability, distance of the diesel release area from the Oakland Inner Harbor, and low hydraulic gradient, the Water Board is on the verge of granting TOFC site closure pending the resolution of deed restriction and SMP questions.  The Water Board is presently reviewing the UO1-8 remedial action plan.",

Soil samples collected from beneath UST-A (The 1,300 gallon UST) were below all the respective detection limits for all constituents.  Initial water samples contained 430,000 µg\/L TPHd, 140,000 µg\/L TPHmo and 11,000 µg\/L TPHg.  After dewatering, the water sample contained 16,000 µg\/L TPHd, 7,600 µg\/L TPHmo, and 160 µg\/L TPHg.  Samples collected from soil beneath UST-B (425-gallon UST) at 10 feet bgs contained 120 ppm TPHd, 32 ppm TPHmo and 49 ppm TPHg.  The soil sample collected at 11 feet bgs contained 15 ppm TPHmo and 26 ppm TPHd.  No benzene was detected in any sample collected during the removals.  Water samples contained 370 ppb TPHmo, 310 ppb TPHd and 5 ppb TPHg.    Ninyo and Moore performed a preferential pathway survey to identify potential conduits such as utilities and wells.  One industrial well was identified within a ¼-mile radius.    On March 12 and 13, 2010, Ninyo and Moore performed a site investigation which included advancing 8 borings.  Maximum concentrations of 4,800 ppm TPHd and 15,000 ppm TPHmo were detected in soil samples from the surface near the above-ground storage tank.  The consultant stated that these concentrations were likely due to asphalt contained in the sample.  No BTEX oxygenates or lead scavengers were detected in soil.  Samples collected from groundwater contained maximum concentrations of 2,500 ppb TPHd and TPHg and 560 pppb TPHmo near the location of the 425 gallon UST.  No BTEX was detected in groundwater.    On May 1, 2010, Ninyo and Moore advanced boring B-9 adjacent to boring B-8 to confirm the consultant’s hypothesis that the TPHmo detected in the previous investigation was asphalt and not representative of soil concentrations.  TPHd was detected at 110 ppm and TPHmo was detected at 460 ppm.  Soil samples collected from step-out borings B-10 to B-12 were not analyzed since B-9 analytical results were low.",

In April 2020, ACDEH issued a No Further Remedial Action Letter base on a review of the case file including the following documents submitted by Terracon Consultants, Inc. on behalf of TDP-Webster, LLC.     • Case Closure Request, County File #RO 3392, dated February 24, 2020    • Limited Subsurface Investigation Report, dated February 24, 2020    • Soil and Groundwater Management Report, dated October 16, 2019    These reports collectively document soil excavation and construction dewatering activities conducted during construction of the underground parking structure and multi-use building at the Site, confirmation groundwater sampling to evaluate post-excavation groundwater quality at and in the vicinity of the Site, and an evaluation of potential vapor intrusion risk from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater to occupants of the TDP-Webster’s recently developed multi-use facility.    With the provision that the information provided to this agency is accurate and representative of currently known Site conditions, ACDEH determined that no further remedial action is required at the Site and therefore ACDEH has no objection to use of the underground parking structure and occupancy of the multi-use building.     TDP-Webster, LLC is still responsible for working with the adjacent property owner to evaluate the source of elevated VOCs in soil vapor detected in the subsurface at the adjacent property located at 2300 Webster Street and mitigate those impacts if it is determined that the source of the VOCs originated from the Site. Upon resolution of this matter, ACDEH will proceed with closure of this Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0003247.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "On July 9, 1987, the valve of an above ground tank containing NaOH was left open, resulting in a 2,000 gallon sodium hydroxide spill toward the rear of the Quaker Oats property, near the railroad ballast and adjacent to neighboring business, Armor Equipment Co. During cleanup of the NaOH spill approximately 1,000 gallons of NaOH was recovered from a relief trench that extended behind the Armor Equipment Co. property. In February 1988, approximately 650 cubic yards of soil with pH greater than 10 was excavated and disposed. Soil sampling during the excavation discovered soils with elevated metal concentrations along property line with Armor Plating Company. Cleanup was completed for the NaOH spill. The case remained open for the elevated metals in soil near property boundary with Armor Equipment Co. The Quaker Oats Facility is capped with asphalt driving surface and parking. Armor Equipment Co. appears to have a closed case by Alameda County, case no. RO0000964.     In May 1989 two petroleum underground storage tanks were removed from the Quaker Oats site and resulted in a LUFT case and soil and groundwater investigation. Approximately 230 cubic yards of soil was excavated during the tank excavations. Four groundwater monitoring wells were installed and monitored. In March 1999 during installation of new surface drain, Quaker Oats performed a limited soil investigation activity and results indicated petroleum hydrocarbons are limited laterally and vertically. NFA was recommended by Alameda County on July 6, 1999 for the LUFT case.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    A Phase I report documented the presence of a service station at the site prior to 1936 when Standard Oil received a permit from the City of Oakland Building Department to reconstruct the service station at the site.  The Phase I also documented the receipt of a permit by Standard Oil from the City for the destruction of a service station building in 1973.  Additional permits between these years also establish the presence of a Standard Oil service station at the site.    A follow up subsurface investigation conducted in June 2017 collected soil, groundwater, and sub-slab vapor samples from beneath the site.  Soil contamination up to 360 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) as motor oil (TPHmo) and up to 27 mg\/kg TPH as diesel (TPHd) were detected.  In groundwater concentrations up to 300 micrograms per liter (µ\/l) TPH as gasoline (TPHg), 220 µ\/l TPHd, and 3,500 µ\/l TPHmo were detected.  These data indicate that an unauthorized release has occurred at the site.  An additional subsurface investigation was conducted in September and November 2018.  Groundwater monitoring wells MW-1 to MW-3, and soil bores SB-5 and SB-6 were installed.  Limited further work was requested by ACDEH, and a work plan submitted in June 2019 to undertake the work.      Further assessment was conducted in September and November 2018 and included the installation of wells MW-1 to MW-3, and soil bores SB-05 and SB-06.  Limited concentrations were documented; however, downgradient areas on the site, including former dispenser islands beneath the onsite building have not been adequately assessed.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site was used for the production of engines for electrical power generation and a iron and brass foundry and manufacturing plant.  The operations ceased in 1987.  Investigations found soil and groundwater impacted by underground storage tank leaks and spills and discharges from equipment. Groundwater monitoring for VOCs was required by SCR 97-051 at one well MW-6, to monitor the shallow aquifer in vicinity of the Machine Shop Vapor Degreaser\/Storm Drain Area.  Remedial actions include soil excavation and groundwater extraction.      Prior to commercial development in 1999, the site was used for foundry operations and engine and wheel manufacturing. The soil and groundwater investigations and soil and groundwater cleanup between 1987 and 1997 were approved by the Water Board adopted Orders Nos. 90-041 and 97-051. Order No. 97-051 required a risk management plan to mitigate risks associated with residual chemicals by requiring: 1) soil containing polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons above specified cleanup levels be covered during redevelopment, 2) soil containing petroleum hydrocarbons and\/or chlorinated solvents above specified cleanup levels encountered during demolition and redevelopment be excavated and properly treated or disposed, and 3) groundwater use be restricted through a recorded environmental restriction.    Regional Water Board Order No. R2-2021-0016 was adopted administratively by the Executive Officer on July 19, 2021, and rescinds the Site Cleanup Requirements Order No. 97-051 for the subject property. The Order requires documentation of well abandonment in compliance with local requirements. A recorded deed restriction remain in effect and prohibits the use of groundwater as a source of drinking water and residential use on portions of the property. The deed restriction also requires compliance with the February 27, 1997, Risk Management Plan (RMP) that includes annual inspection reports for the capped soil. An RMP amendment pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Covenant is recommended, since groundwater monitoring is no longer required.",

In 2003 the site was vacated and all structures were removed. Soil and groundwater were impacted by the materials used in the manufacture of the asphaltic membranes and mixtures. A risk assessment has been performed and has determined that additional site remediation is necessary to reduce the risk of exposure of pollutants to human and ecological receptors.

Petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil and groundwater but the soil excavated during the tank pit was placed back in each tank pit.  In October 1998, soil borings were advanced at the site and three monitoring wells installed.  Sporadic monitoring of the groundwater wells has been performed.  Most recent groundwater monitoring indicates no substantial vapor intrusion risk remains at the site.      A well survey conducted in October 2014 did not reveal the presence of beneficial use wells within 2,000 feet of the site.",

Excavation of impacted soil has occurred and was followed by ISCO application (pit &amp; injection).  This LOP case will remain open for the monitoring of the effectiveness of the remedial actions.  The case was opened in 1989 following the discovery of a release from the UST fueling system during a 1988 site assessment conducted for a service station exchange between Texaco and Exxon.  A follow up assessment conducted in 1989 detected 11,000 mg\/kg TPHg and 40 mg\/kg benzene in soil; 9,500 µg\/L TPHg in groundwater; and 6,100 µg\/L TPHg and 10 µg\/L benzene in soil vapor indicating that a release from the underground storage tanks had occurred.      Two gasoline USTs, one diesel UST and one waste-oil UST (WOT) were replaced in November and December 1991.  Soil samples from the fuel tank pit were reported to contain up to 10,000 mg\/kg TPHg and 130 mg\/kg benzene.  Groundwater remediation occurred from 1990 to 1993.   A 1,000-gallon waste-oil UST was removed on September 22, 1997.  Soil samples collected beneath the waste-oil tank were below the detection limits for many constituents with TEPH at 32 mg\/kg, TRPH at 120 mg\/kg and TTLC lead at 7.2 mg\/kg.  A P&amp;T groundwater remediation system operated at the site from 1991 until 1996.  A dual-phase extraction pilot test was performed in 2001 and found that DPE would be an effective remediation method for the site.  An AS\/DPE feasibility test was performed in January 2014. The test results indicates focused DPE and\/or AS\/DPE may be an effective remedial option.  Based on the data ACDEH recomended preparation and implementation of a CAP using DPE supplemented by AS if sufficient water is present beneath the site. High intensity targeted (HIT) AS\/DPE event conducted 7\/28- 8\/01\/2014.  Another HIT round performed 8\/03- 8\/18\/2016.  On-site monitoring wells destroyed in January 2019 prior to station demolition.  Additional soil excavation and ISCO application occurred as part of the remedial strategy prior to hotel construction. Perimeter wells remain for monitoring the effectiveness of the remedial activities.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This case meets the low-threat closure criteria in the State Water Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy , as shown below.     General Criteria  a. The unauthorized release is located within the service area of a public water system;   b. The unauthorized release consists only of petroleum;   c. The unauthorized (“primary”) release from the UST system has been stopped;   d. Free product has been removed to the maximum extent practicable;   e. A conceptual site model that assesses the nature, extent, and mobility of the release has been developed;   f. Secondary source has been removed to the extent practicable;   g. Soil or groundwater has been tested for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and results       reported in accordance with Health and Safety Code section 25296.15; and   h. Nuisance as defined by Water Code section 13050 does not exist at the site.    Media-Specific Criteria  1. Groundwater – The Site meets Criteria 5.a. of the LTCP as follows: Groundwater was not encountered during excavation at the Site. Also, the upgradient monitoring wells at the Chevron site located about 200 feet downgradient of the Site contained low or non-detectable concentrations of TPH-g, BTEX, and fuel oxygenates.  2. Petroleum Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air – The Site meets Criteria 2.c. of the LTCP as follows: Given the location of the Site beneath the BART and Highway 24 overcrossings, no building is expected to be constructed at the Site in the future and therefore, vapor intrusion is not an issue.   3. Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Exposure -- The Site meets Criteria 3.a. of the LTCP as follows: No benzene, ethylbenzene, and naphthalene soil concentrations exceed the direct contact and outdoor air exposure criteria in Table 1 of the LTCP for residential and commercial\/industrial use.     Additional Comments:      The Site is located along the east sidewalk of Telegraph Avenue in Oakland, under the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Highway 24 overcrossings, approximately 50 feet north of the 56th Street intersection. A 650-gallon underground storage tank (UST) was discovered during seismic retrofit construction activities for BART on July 13, 2013.  The UST was 8-feet long and 44-inches wide and contained water with a diesel fuel sheen.  Approximately 711 gallons of fluid and rinsate were removed from the UST on July 16, 2010. The UST was removed later that day under the oversight of the City of Oakland Fire Department.    Holes were observed in the UST and an obvious petroleum odor was noticed in the soils in the vicinity of the UST. 25 tons of petroleum-impacted soils were removed in the vicinity of the former UST. The size of excavation was limited by surrounding overcrossing footings, roadway, sidewalk, and reach of the excavator.  The size of the final excavation was approximately eight feet deep and irregularly-shaped. Five soil samples were collected from the UST excavation at a depth of approximately 8 feet and analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as diesel (TPHd), TPH as motor oil (TPHmo) by EPA Method 8015B; volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by EPA Method 8260B; and leaking underground storage tank (LUFT) 5 metals by EPA Method 6010\/7000. TPHg, TPHd, and TPHmo were detected in all but one of the soil samples collected from the UST excavation.  TPHg concentrations ranged from 5.9 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) to 400 mg\/kg; TPHd concentrations ranged from 4.2 mg\/kg to 110 mg\/kg; and TPHmo concentrations ranged from 7.7 to 14 mg\/kg.  Several VOCs were also detected in each of the soil samples; however, none were reported at concentrations above San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board’s Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) for shallow soils at residential or commercial sites.  LUFT 5 metals were detected below ESLs in each of the soil samples.  BART contractors completed the backfill activities during the completion of the seismic retrofit activities at the Site.  On August 6,2010, NRC loaded and transported two soil bins containing the 25-tons of soil from the excavation to Hay Road Class II Landfill in Vacaville, California.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This case was closed by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) on January 14, 2014 over the objections of Alameda County Environmental Health (ACEH).    An unauthorized leak was reported in January 1988 following the removal of one UST. Soil vapor extraction was conducted between December 1993 and June 1996, which removed 6,550 pounds of total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg). Approximately 151,089 gallons of contaminated groundwater were removed from the subsurface.     It is the position of the SWRCB that groundwater data demonstrates water quality objectives have been achieved or have nearly been achieved for all constituents except for benzene.  The petroleum release is limited to the shallow soil and groundwater. No public supply wells regulated by the California Department of Public Health or surface water bodies are located within 1,000 feet of projected plume boundary. No other water supply wells ~.Yere identified within 1,000 feet of the projected plume boundary in files reviewed.  Water is provided to water users near. the Site by the East Bay Municipal Utilities Department. The affected groundwater is not currently being used as a source of drinking water and it is highly unlikely that the affected groundwater will be used as a source of drinking water or in the foreseeable future.  Other designated beneficial uses of impacted groundwater are not threatened and it is highly unlikely that they will be considering these factors in the context of the site setting.  Remaining petroleum hydrocarbon ·constituents are limited, stable and concentrations declining.    It is the position of ACEH that it has not been demonstrated the site meets Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (LTCP) General Criteria e, f, or h and Media-Specific Criteria 1 -Groundwater and Critertia 2. Petroleum Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air as discussed below.    General Criteria e: A CSM that is deficient in adequately assessing the vertical and lateral extent of the soil and groundwater plume has been generated.  The vertical and offsite extent of these plumes remains undefined at the down gradient edge of the property.  Post remediation confirmation borings adjacent to the structure (borings CB-7 and CB-8) documented residual TPHg concentrations of up to 5,700 mg\/kg with benzene concentrations below an elevated detection limits (&lt;2.5 mg\/kg) at eight feet BGS.  The reported CB-8 TPHg concentration is significantly higher than the concentrations reported in soil samples from adjacent pre-remediation samples from MW-2 and VWR-1- collected at similar depths.  As boring location CB-8 is closer to the building than either MW-2 or VWR-1, the TPHg concentration indicates the radius of influence or the remediation system may not have effectively addressed the portion of the contamination beneath the building.  Depth to water has been as shallow as 3.37 feet BGS and is typically in the 6- to 7.5-foot range.  These depths are shallow enough for utility trenches to act as preferential pathways.  Brunsing Associates, Inc., consultant for the Responsible Party, identified the preferential pathway data gap and recommended an investigation be conducted to determine if the sewer utility trenches within 24th Street.  ACEH has requested a soil gas study be performed to evaluate potential indoor air hazards at the site.     General Criteria f:  It is the position of ACEH that determination of the appropriateness of the extent of removal of the residual source has not been established as the contaminant plume extends beneath the building, and has not been evaluated or delineated.  As discussed General Criteria e, residual hydrocarbon mass remains in soil predominately on the northern portion of the property in the vicinity of the building.  This is supported by the collection of post remediation confirmation soil sample in the area of represented by boring CB-8.     General Criteria h: The down gradient extent of groundwater contamination has not been determined.  Specifically if the 24th Street utility trenches are impacted by contaminated groundwater may present a nuisance condition.    Media-Specific Criteria 1. Groundwater: Residual hydrocarbon mass remains in soil as evidenced by samples CB-4 and CB-8 containing TPHg at concentrations of 1,700 mg\/kg and 5,400 mg\/kg, respectfully.  However only one post remediation ground water sample was recovered (CB-3), reported to contain 23,000 ug\/L TPHg and 1,100 ug\/L benzene, from a depth of 8 to 10 feet BGS.  ACEH has been concerned that consistently submerged wells screens for the onsite monitoring wells have been providing non-representative dissolved phase contaminant concentrations.   As a consequence ACEH believes the extent of removal of the residual source has not been established.  ACEH finds that the plume length has not been delineated along 24th Street and therefore does not meet this Class 2 scenario as presented by the SWRCB.    Media-Specific Criteria 2. Petroleum Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air:  The site is not an active gasoline service station; and very few soil samples have been collected within the top 5 feet at the site.  Shallow soil samples collected in the upper 5 feet are reported to contain up to 100 mg\/kg TPHg and 9.1 mg\/kg benzene.  Based on the concentrations reported in soil and groundwater in the vicinity of the building, contamination is likely present beneath the structure; however, no vapor intrusion to indoor air studies have been performed as requested by ACEH.  The SWRCB states that the Media-Specific Criteria is met by Class 3 which requires a finding that, for sites with no oxygen data and benzene concentrations are than 100 ug\/L, the bioattenuation zone is a continuous zone that provides a separation of at least 5 vertical feet between the dissolve phase benzene and the foundation of the existing or potential buildings; and contain a total TPH (TPHg and TPHd combined) less than 100 mg\/kg throughout the entire depth of the bioattenuation zone.  It is the position of ACEH that there is no supporting documentation that the 5-foot vertical separation condition has been met.  Groundwater has been as shallow as 3.37 feet, and the depth of the foundation of the warehouse building has not been revealed.  There are two data points in the case file documenting soil concentrations in the upper 5 feet of soil.  One fails the TPH concentration criteria.  By 8 feet, the most recent soil data documents TPHg at 5,700 mg\/kg alongside the building with older data documenting 7,000 mg\/kg TPHg at 7.0 feet.  It is the opinion of ACEH that the site fails to meet any of the scenarios for the Media-Specific Criteria 2- Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at https:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.",

On March 22, 2000, the product lines and dispensers were removed and replaced.  Evidence of (a) release(s) was noted at each of the dispenser locations.  Petroleum hydrocarbons reporting up to 6,200 mg\/kg TPHg were detected in soil samples collected from beneath the dispensers and product lines.  This case was opened following transfer from Oakland Fire Dept. in January 2002 and only investigated the dispenser release.      Soil excavation an subsequent over excavation resulted in a total of 133 cu yds disposed off site.  Four groundwater monitoring wells were installed in February\/March  2002.  Up to 130,000 µg\/L TPHg and 10,000 µg\/L MTBE was detected in groundwater. Continued monitoring has occurred through late 2017, when based on decreasing concentrations, the shallow contaminant plume was determined to be stable\/decreasing and the well network sampling discontinued.  BTEX compounds have not been detected in the groundwater monitoring well network since November, 2011.    Four environmental investigations have been performed since 1997.  The most recent, an investigation conducted in 2013, recovered depth discrete soil and groundwater sample for analysis.  The grab-groundwater sample collected from CPT-2 (HP-2) at a depth of 40-44 feet contains 230 ug\/L TPHg, indicating the deeper groundwater plume may not be defined as no down gradient groundwater samples have been collected from this depth.

Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Cleanup Site Case No. T10000006491\/RO000 was opened in 2015 by ACDEH to investigate and evaluate impacts to human health and the environment associated with an unauthorized release from one UST and associated UST system components that were removed from the site in 1991.  Site investigation activities associated with the LUFT case were conducted from 2014 to 2017 to evaluate the extent of subsurface impacts to soil, soil vapor and groundwater from the UST system release.    This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH determined that the site does met all the LTCP General Criteria and Media Specific Criteria for Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Exposure.  The site does not meet the Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater and the Media Specific Criteria for Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air. Although the site does not meet the distance criteria to the nearest surface water body, ACDEH has determined that the length of the plume is less than the distance to the nearest surface water body. Additionally, although the site does not meet the soil vapor sampling depth criteria, soil vapor concentrations detected at three feet bgs meet both the residential and commercial no bioattenuation zone vapor concentrations at a commercial facility.  Therefore, the site poses a low risk to human health and safety and the environment. The determination was based on receptors and environmental conditions identified at and in the vicinity of the site at the time of closure and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios.    ACDEH recommends that during the environmental due diligence process (initiated as part of activities including, but not limited to, property transactions, bank refinancing, and redevelopment) that the site and parcels in the vicinity of the site be evaluated for risk from and exposure to potential chemicals of concern identified at this site.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has evaluated this case for closure in accordance with the State Water Resources Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy for petroleum related contaminants and has determined that the site qualifies for closure as a low risk site. ACDEH’s closure determination was based on an analysis of risk to human health and the environment under the current land use scenario and with the provision that the information provided to this agency is accurate and representative of site conditions, and was limited to:     • Exposure to releases of petroleum related contamination from underground storage tank systems; and  • Identified receptors at and in the vicinity of the site under the land use scenarios and site development configurations at the time of case closure.     This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the LTCP criteria for risks associated with petroleum related contaminants released to the subsurface from USTs at the site. ACDEH has determined that the site fails General Criteria b, Petroleum hydrocarbon only release due to non-petroleum related VOC detections in groundwater, and the Media Specific Criteria for Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Exposure due to the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil. However, at the time of case closure evaluation, the site was developed with an asphalt parking lot and small brick building with a concrete slab foundation used for storage and thus risk from exposure to residual soil and groundwater contamination at the site is limited to subsurface construction workers. Therefore, although the site does not meet all the LTCP criteria, exposure risk can be controlled through land use restrictions and proper soil and groundwater management procedures and health and safety protocols, and thus ACDEH has determined that the site qualifies for closure as a low risk site from petroleum related constituents released to the subsurface from the USTs. Risk to receptors under different land use scenarios or site configurations, or from other potential contaminants of concern associated with historic land use at and\/or in the vicinity of the site were not considered in the closure determination of this LUST case. Therefore, if a change in land use or site redevelopment is planned, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2. ACDEH recommends that environmental due diligence activities associated with site redevelopment planning, property transactions or bank refinancing for the site be conducted under ACDEH oversight and include an evaluation of potential contaminants of concern in soil, groundwater and soil vapor from all historic land uses at and in the vicinity of the site and associated risk to human health and the environment.     At the time of closure of LUST Case RO0003162\/TO600100302, the site consisted of a single parcel (APN 19-55-11) with an approximate area of 1.36 acres. The property was developed with an asphalt paved parking lot and a small brick commercial building used as storage for vehicles, parts, and various other items for vehicle restoration. The Property is located on the northwestern side of Calcot Place near the intersection of Calcot Place and 23rd Avenue, in the City of Oakland. The Property is bounded by Interstate I-880 to the west and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks to the east.     Due to residual subsurface contamination on the property associated with historic land use and operations, the property owner is responsible for complying with the following requirements:  1. Notifying contractors and utility workers of residual subsurface contamination at the site prior to implementing any work that could result in exposure to subsurface contamination. Each contractor shall be responsible for the safety of its employees and site visitors and must adhere to a site-specific health and safety plan prepared for the work in accordance with California Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements and use of properly trained personnel in accordance with California Code of Regulations, Title 29, Part 1910.120 Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standards; and   2. Notifying ACDEH (as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2) prior to permitting and implementation of site redevelopment activities that modify the existing site configuration or land use at the time of this case closure. Upon notification, ACDEH will re-evaluate the risk to human health relative to the proposed modifications to existing site improvements or proposed redevelopment project. ACDEH recommends that notification be provided in the initial stages of the planning and permitting process to facilitate interagency coordination and an efficient permitting process.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Last Updated by Jonathan Sanders of ACDEH on 4\/1\/2020:  ACDEH opened this case in 2015 due to the presence of multiple contaminants on on-site soil, groundwater, and soil vapor. Environmental contamination at the Site was identified as part of the environmental due diligence process associated with the acquisition of the Site for redevelopment. Corrective actions to address identified contaminants of concern have been implemented in conjunction with redevelopment activities. Contaminants that exceed applicable environmental screening levels and the identified sources with each of these contaminants are summarized below:     (1) Multiple residential structures were present on-site from at least the 1900s and were demolished in the 1950s. The presence and demolition of these historic on-site residential structures is associated with contamination from bulk petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and lead (Pb) in surface soils and fill material that is present to a depth of up to 3 feet below ground surface at the Site;    (2) Construction debris from the demolition of the Cypress Freeway following the Loma Prieta Earthquake in the early 1990s. The presence of these construction debris and fill is associated with contamination from  TPH, PAHs, Pb in fill materials up to a depth of approximately 3 feet below ground surface at the Site;    (3) Aeolian deposition from proximity of major roadways which is associated with Pb and PAHs in surface soil;    (4) Commercial laundering and cleaning operations from the 1920s through the 1970s located adjacent and to the northwest of the Site which is associated with contamination from tetrachloroethene (PCE) and associated daughter products in soil vapor (including along utilities) and groundwater at the Site; and    (5) Retail automobile service and repair from the 1920s through the 1970s located adjacent and to the northeast of the Site which is associated with contamination from PCE and associated daughter products and TPH identified in soil vapor and groundwater at the Site.     Shallow soil contaminations that exceeds construction worker exposure levels is anticipated to be removed as part of remedial excavation activities and direct exposure for residential and commercial receptors will be controlled via the installation of hardscape throughout the footprint of the Site as an engineering control. During earthwork activities, dust control measures were implemented as a control for potential community exposure.    There are no known complete exposure pathways to on-site receptors for groundwater. Because groundwater contamination at the Site is attributed to off-site sources, potentially complete exposure pathways for off-site receptors to groundwater have not been evaluated or considered.    Potential vapor intrusion risk at the Site is addressed via the installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system (VIMS) comprised of a vapor barrier system and a sub-barrier vapor collection and ventilation system. Based on the conceptual site model for the Site, the area where a potentially unacceptable vapor intrusion risk has been identified at the Site is limited to the western portion of the Site. Therefore, VIMS are proposed for installation only on the western building.     Construction at the Site is currently underway and ACDEH will require implementation of administrative and institutional controls prior to issuance of a no further action letter. These controls are required as part of long term stewardship requirements and will include recordation of a land use covenant requiring maintenance of engineering controls (hardscape and VIMS) and submittal of a long term risk management plan that is written in plain language and intended for the lay-person.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site has operated as a gasoline service station since at least the 1920s. The Site historically housed at least four petroleum underground storage tanks (USTs) consisting of one 6,000-gallon leaded gasoline UST; one 8,000-gallon super-unleaded gasoline UST; one 10,000-gallon regular unleaded gasoline UST and one 550-gallon waste oil UST. The waste oil UST was removed in 1986 and the gasoline and diesel USTs were removed in September 1990. Soil contamination was observed at the time the USTs were uncovered. Site investigations have been conducted since 1989. Petroleum-related contamination remains at the Site in soil, groundwater, and soil vapor including petroleum product floating on groundwater and very low levels of chlorinated volatile organic compounds have recently been reported in soil vapor. Cleanup work at the Site has included the following:  1990 - approximately 1,950 cubic yards of petroleum-contaminated soil was excavated and disposed when the USTs were removed.   1994 to 1995 - approximately 350,000 gallons of groundwater was pumped, cleaned, and disposed using a groundwater treatment system.  2009 - a five-day test was conducted of a treatment method known as dual phase extraction (DPE) which removes and cleans soil vapor and groundwater together.   2012 - a DPE system removed approximately 240 pounds of petroleum hydrocarbons from soil vapor and groundwater over a two-week period.   2012 to 2013 - approximately 13 gallons of liquid petroleum product was removed by hand from monitoring wells. Since 2013, absorbent socks have been used to remove approximately 13 additional gallons of petroleum product floating on groundwater.    2020 - DPE cleanup was pilot tested over four days in December. Approximately 675 pounds of petroleum hydrocarbons were removed from the soil vapor and groundwater. Because the Pilot Test was considered successful, ACDEH requested BP Products North America Company (BP)  to perform additional cleanup at the Site. Cleanup is proposed consisting of a series of month-long DPE events similar to the December 2020 pilot test.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In 1932 and 1973 the site was used as a service station. The number of generations of petroleum underground storage tanks that have been installed at the site is unknown. Four 1,000-gallon fuel underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed in 1973 when the service station was decommissioned. Between 1999 and 2001, the dispenser island, sumps, the hydraulic hoist, building foundations, garbage enclosure, yard lights and asphalt were removed including an orphaned 1,000-gallon gasoline UST, an orphaned 550-gallon used-oil UST, and a buried 55-gallon drum (apparently a makeshift used-oil underground storage tank). In November of 2002 approximately 1,584 tons of hydrocarbon-impacted soil was excavated to approximately 12 to 14 feet below ground surface and transported to Allied Waste Landfill in Manteca, California from the areas of the former USTs, dispenser island, hydraulic lift, and sumps. While the excavation was open, 900 pounds of oxygen release compound was placed beneath the ground to provide oxygen to help degrade any residual petroleum hydrocarbon mass. There have been multiple investigations at the Site, which include installation of groundwater monitoring wells, surficial soil sampling, a remedial pilot test of groundwater cleanup technology (air sparging), and collection of soil vapor samples. In April 2019, sixty-nine (69) on-site borings were advanced with the continuous collection of soil samples and logged in 0.5-foot intervals to determine the present-day soil concentrations for lead-impacted soil on site. In June 2019, site soil was tested for treatment of lead using phosphate amendments, however, none of the phosphate reagents tested was successful in reducing the bio-accessibility of the lead in surface soils at the Site. To date, 18 groundwater monitoring wells, 8 air sparge wells, 76 exploratory borings, and 15 soil vapor probes have been installed, and numerous surface, near- surface, and deeper soil samples have been collected both on and near the site to characterize and monitor environmental conditions. Remedial action was implemented in 2021 consisting of 1) excavation of petroleum-contaminated soil to 15 feet below ground surface 2) placement of gypsum into the base of the excavations to reduce petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in on-site groundwater and soil within the saturated zone and 3) placement of clean backfill to the ground surface. The remedial action was completed in November 2021. At this time Alameda County Department of Environmental Health is accepting comments for the proposed case closure of this Site, until August 15, 2022. Please send comments to the primary caseworker, whose email address can be found on this webpage.",

Soil, soil vapor, groundwater, and indoor air sampling was completed at the site in 2014.  Indoor air sampling indicated vapor intrusion concerns are limited to a storage building (Building 2).  Recent detected sub-slab and indoor air concentrations are above the January 2019 Regional Water Board’s ESLs for sub-slab vapor intrusion and direct exposure human health risk under commercial use.  The site was closed with a land use covenant (LUC) dated May 20, 2015 that restricts access to Building 2 and requires further evaluation if the site is to be redeveloped in the future. Access to Building 2 has been restricted. ACDEH determined that regulatory oversight and additional investigation and corrective activities should be conducted under the former Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Case No. RO0003135 and administratively close SCP Case No RO0003348. As outlined in ACDEH's directive letter dated April 8, 2019 further investigation including an update Site Conceptual Model and Data Gap Work Plan as well as a Feasibility Study\/Corrective Action Plan have been requested for the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site is the location of a former aircraft engine test facility most recently operated by the Rolls Royce Corporation.  Facility decommissioning\/removal which included the removal of the three remaining USTs was performed in the last half of 2019 and early 2020.  The site has entered the verification monitoring phase following completion of the remedial actions.  No above ground structures remain on-site and the site has been covered with pavement and residual foundation slabs remain for a hardscape cover.    As part of the remedial activities following facility demolition, a total of approximately 3228 tons of soil were disposed off site from five excavated areas of concern.  Confirmation sampling was conducted at the excavated areas, with one location, represented by sample EX-8, having a residual TPH concentration above the clean up level.        In September 1992, the test engine facility experienced a release of 1,143 gallons of Jet-A fuel.  In October 1998, petroleum hydrocarbons, identified as a mixture of degraded motor oil, diesel, and\/or kerosene, was observed floating on groundwater infiltrating a trench.  Prior to 1978, gray water- water potentially containing oil from test cell engine wash down- was discharged directly to an unlined drainage ditch.  Between 1978 and 1992 gray water was passed through an oil-water separator prior to discharge.  From 1992 onward gray water was transported off-site for disposal.  In Spring 1994 the facility experienced a release of gray water into the surrounding environment.  SWIs conducted for the facility identified construction debris and other refuse in site soil.  Source of the debris is believed to be from the North Port of Oakland Refuse Disposal site located to the north and to the west of the test engine facility.  Three groundwater monitoring wells were installed in 1996 after an inital investigation identified petroleum contaminants at the site.  Groundwater was measured at approximately 3 feet bgs and determined to contain up to 1,300 ug\/L TPHj and 2,200 ug\/L TPHd.  SWIs conducted between 1996 and 2002 revealed the presence of up to 42,000 mg\/kg TPHj, 29,000 mg\/kg TPHd, and 13,000 TPHg in soil.  In 1998 trenching operations revealed oil floating on infiltrating groundwater in one of the trenches.  Fourteen additional wells were installed in 2007.  Groundwater concentrations for the well network were report up to 34,000 ug\/L TPHo, 12,000 ug\/L TPHd and 9,100 ug\/L TPHj for the inial monitoring event.  Separate phase hydrocarbon concentrations continue to be observed in one well (MW-18) and in a few soil bores advanced for GGW collection and analysis.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is occupied by a single story commercial building with adjacent paved parking.  The building is on a raised floor with basement and is currently occupied by Atthowe Fine Arts Services for storage, packaging, and shipping of fine art.  One 500-gallon UST, reported to contain diesel fuel, and a fuel dispenser were removed from the site in March 1991.  Analysis of confirmation samples performed following over excavation of the UST pit determined residual concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline (TPHg),  and benzene at concentrations of 210 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) and 0.4 mg\/kg, respectively.   The case was opened in January 1993 following documentation that a release had occurred.      In 1995, three groundwater monitoring wells were installed and sampled quarterly for approximately one year.  Maximum concentrations reported through 1996 included 220 micrograms per liter (ug\/L) TPHg, 10,000 ug\/L TPH as diesel (TPHd), and 3.5 ug\/L, 1.0 ug\/L, 3.0 ug\/L for benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX) compounds, respectively.  Ethylbenzene (E) concentrations were reported below the laboratory reporting limits.      In 1999, to evaluate the case for closure, ACDEH requested recovery of groundwater samples to to include analysis for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE).   The monitoring event, conducted in August 1999, encountered a viscous free product (FP) in monitoring well MW-1, additionally FP was subsequently encountered in wells MW-2 and MW-3 in April 2000.  The FP in the three wells was identified as Bunker C fuel oil.  The source of the fuel oil has not been identified.  Additionally, secondary evidence of free product concentrations of TPHd and TPH motor oil (TPHmo) were reported in water samples from MW-1 and MW-3 during the April 2000 monitoring event.  BTEX and MTBE concentrations were reported below laboratory reporting limits in wells MW-2 and MW-3, the two wells sampled for these chemicals.  The monitoring wells were not sampled between June 2000 and June 2015.  Depth to water measurements for the seven groundwater monitoring events have ranged between 9.70 feet to 13.40 feet.      An investigation consisting of both on- and off-site soil bores was conducted in 2013 to delineate the extent of the free phase hydrocarbons.  TPH was not reported in in soil or grab-groundwater (GGW) samples collected from the two off-site soil bores,  advanced to the west, roughly in the down gradient direction across Market Street, and soil bores B-5 and B-9 appear to have delineated the TPH plume to the south and east.      In 2015, an on-site water supply well was decommissioned.  The supply well, approximately 200 feet deep, was situated about 100 feet cross gradient from the former UST location and was reported to be last used prior to 1985.  Prior to its abandonment, a water sample was collected from the well and analyzed for TPHg, TPHd, TPHmo, BTEX and the fuel oxygenates (FOs) MTBE, diisopropyl ether (DIPE), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA), and the polynulear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNAs) naphthalene, acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, phenanthrene, fluorene, chrysene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(a) pyrene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)anthracene, indeno(1,2,3-c,d)pyrene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, and benzo(g,h,i)perylene.  Benzene, at a concentration of 6.8 ug\/L, was the only compound documented above the laboratory reporting limit.      An investigation consisting of both on- and off-site soil bores was also conducted in 2015.  Based on the findings of the investigation, the contaminant plume remains undefined to the north, in the up gradient direction from the former UST.  Soil and GGW samples collected from bores advanced within the boundary of the  plume (B-10 and B-11) were reported to contain PNAs.  The three monitoring wells were also sampled, with FP present in each well.  No BTEX, FOs, or naphthalene concentrations were detected in groundwater recovered from the wells.  However, concentrations of several PNAs were reported above their respective laboratory reporting limits.  Additionally, two soil gas samples were recovered for a vapor intrusion to indoor air evaluation.  BTEX compounds were reported present in both samples at concentrations up to 17 micrograms per cubic meter (ug\/m3), 94 ug\/m3, 120 ug\/m3, and 530 ug\/m3, respectively.  Naphthalene concentrations were not reported above the laboratory reporting limit, and oxygen was reported at 8.29 percent (%) and 9.10%.    A well survey was conducted in 2016 with a search radius of 1,000 feet around the property.  The survey contained Department of Water Resources (DWR) and Alameda County Public Works Agency (ACPWA) records review.  No supply wells were identified within the search radius; however, a cathodic protection well is identified approximately 550 feet in the southly direction, roughly down gradient of the site.    Findings of the August 2017 investigation did not locate an up gradient source of contaminants.  ACDEH proposes a meeting to discuss the case and review for potential case closure.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Current Land-use at time of Case Closure    The subject property (APN 10-776-8)  is located at 378 Grand Avenue between Staten Avenue and Perkins Street, in the northwest portion of the City of Oakland, approximately 2 ½ miles east of San Francisco bay, approximately ¼ mile southwest of Interstate 580, and 680 feet north of Lake Merritt.  At the time of this case closure, the site is developed with an apartment building with a barber shop and hairstyling salon occupying the first floor. This diesel UST release case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the current site use and the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  This case is closed to the current residential and commercial land use.  Due to residual contamination, the site is closed with site management requirements that include notifying Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) of a proposed change in land use to any residential or conservative land use on the ground floor, or if any redevelopment or building alteration is proposed that affects or disturbs the existing subsurface conditions at the site.     Adjacent Property(ies) Land-use at Time of Case Closure    The site is located in a mixed commercial and residential area.  At the time of this case closure, potential off-site contamination is likely on Grand Avenue, but may not extend onto properties across Grand Avenue.  However, should off-site redevelopment occur, ACDEH recommends evaluating the areas of redevelopment for chemicals of concern that were identified on this site.     Historic Land-use \/ Site Investigation    The owner had no prior knowledge of a tank or previous activities conducted at the site.  On March 2, 2016, one 1,500-gallon underground storage tank (UST) used for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel was removed from the sidewalk at the southern side of the site.  During the UST removal, sidewall and bottom soil samples were collected and 12.5 tons of impacted soil were over-excavated to remove contaminated soil. In order to further determine the extent of the contamination and to evaluate the site consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants, additional soil, grab groundwater, and soil gas investigation was performed.    Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern    The main chemicals of concern (COCs) at the site were total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPH-d).  Because the site is capped with the building slab foundation and the groundwater depth is at 40.5 feet below ground surface (bgs), the site poses a low potential threat to human health and safety for vapor intrusion and direct contact to soil for residential land use.  As groundwater is not used as drinking water at the site, the most applicable sensitive receptor is Lake Merritt.    Remediation Activities    Corrective action consisting of excavation of the USTs and contaminated soil have been completed.    Case Closure &amp; Future Site Management Requirements    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP). This diesel UST release case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the current site use and the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  The site meets the criterion for vapor intrusion for scenario 3A and for direct contact and outdoor air criterion for soil for residential land use. For groundwater, the site does not meet scenarios 1 through 4; however, a determination been made that under current and reasonably expected future scenarios, the contaminant plume poses a low threat to human health and safety and to the environment and water quality objectives will be achieved within a reasonable time frame, and therefore meets scenario 5.    In regard to the groundwater evaluation and data, one grab groundwater sample was collected in native soil immediately adjacent and downgradient of the tank excavation area.  Laboratory analysis showed the following: Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPH-d) at 360 µg\/L; benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and total xylenes (BTEX) all at &lt;0.5 µg\/L; and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) at &lt;0.5 µg\/L.  Based on the clayey lithology presented in the boring log and a thirty foot separation between the zone of soil impact and groundwater it is likely that the TPH-d detection in groundwater is a result of sampling bias due to drag down of contamination in the borehole.  Although the plume boundary has not been defined through sampling, groundwater was encountered in sandy silt, and therefore, the TPH-d is not likely to be mobile   As groundwater is not used as drinking water at the site, the most applicable sensitive receptor is Lake Merritt, which is located approximately 680 feet downgradient of the site, and the concentration of TPH-d at 360 µg\/L in groundwater is below the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board Environmental Screening Level (ESL) of 640 µg\/L for aquatic habitat.  In addition, the depth to groundwater at the site is 40.5 feet, so the likelihood is low that groundwater will interact with surface water.   Based on the evaluation, the site is being considered for closure as a low-risk site.  Due to residual contamination, the site is closed consistent with the current site use of commercial ground floor and residential upper floors with site management requirements   If there is a proposed in land use on the ground floor to any residential or conservative land use, or if redevelopment occurs, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.   ACDEH will reevaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate Health and Safety procedures by the Responsible Party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is comprised of five structures (Building A, Building B, Building C, Building D, and Building E) across three parcels spanning a total of 3.5 acres. Building B is subdivided into two discrete sub-units: Building B South and Building B North. All on-site structures are single story slab-on-grade construction except Building C which has a crawl space.    Constituents of concern at the Site consist of chlorinated hydrocarbons including perchloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE), trans- and cis-1,2-dichloroethene (tDCE &amp; cDCE), vinyl chloride (VC), chloroform and petroleum hydrocarbons, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (collectively BTEX),  bulk gasoline range hydrocarbons (TPHg), and fuel oxygenate methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The primary risk driving constituents of concern are associated with vapor intrusion and consist of PCE, TCE, VC. Benzene, chloroform, and 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane have also been identified in sub-slab vapor at concentrations representing a potentially unacceptable vapor intrusion risk, however, the risk contribution of these species relative to PCE, TCE, and VS are minor.    The source of PCE in soil and soil vapor is attributed to on-site releases which have impacted shallow soil. PCE has not been reported as present in groundwater samples. The source of TCE and VC in groundwater appears to be from an off-site source located to the east of the Site. TCE and VC in soil vapor has been attributed to off-gassing from groundwater and no soil sources of TCE or VC have been identified at this junction.    Environmental risk to on-site occupants is currently being addressed via the implementation of corrective actions intended to remove identified on-site source areas of PCE and to control vapor intrusion risk from the groundwater source via the implementation of vapor intrusion and migration mitigation measures.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "LUST Case No. T10000009413\/RO0003231 was opened by ACDEH in 2016 after receipt of an Underground Storage Tank Closure Report indicated residual contamination remained in soil following removal of two former single-wall steel 750-gallon underground storage tanks (USTs). On November 4 to 6, 2015, the two USTs and associated vertical piping were removed from beneath the sidewalk along Penniman Avenue at the southwest edge of the Site. The USTs had dimensions of approximately 3.5 feet in diameter and 8 feet long. Maximum concentrations of 200 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) of total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPH-g) and 170 mg\/kg of nickel were detected in soil samples collected beneath the former USTs at 11 feet below ground surface (bgs) which indicated an unauthorized release had occurred at the site from the former USTs.  Site investigation activities have been conducted at the site in November 2015, March 2017, April, May and June 2018, and between February and August 2019 to evaluate the extent of soil, soil vapor, and groundwater impacts to on- and offsite- receptors from the UST release. Soil impacts were generally detected at 15 and 20 feet bgs. Shallow groundwater impacts have been laterally defined and are limited to the vicinity of the former UST footprint. Groundwater impacts above maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) were delineated in the downgradient direction which limits the plume length to less than 50 feet.     This Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) case has been evaluated relative to the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants and was found to be eligible for closure. Case closure for this site is pending monitoring well destruction which is expected following reimbursement for accumulated expenses from the State Water Resources Control Board Underground Storage Tank Cleanup Fund.    During the 2018 Site investigation activities, tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) were identified as constituents of potential concern (COPCs) for soil vapor. As a result, a separate Local Oversight Program case (Case No. RO0003353) was established to address the chlorinated volatile organic compound (CVOC) impacts on-Site, which appear unrelated to the UST. Additional investigation and reporting will continue to be conducted to address the chlorinated impacts associated with LOP Case No. RO0003353.",

In December 1990 the gasoline and diesel USTs and any encountered piping were removed, and the USTs and residual liquid were disposed as hazardous waste. Sludge removed from the diesel UST was reportedly found to contain chlorinated hydrocarbons. The two waste oil USTs were removed in February of 1991. Historical records indicate that plastic sheeting and an unknown volume of impacted soil were placed into the remedial diesel and gasoline excavations to prevent wall failure below the groundwater table and clean imported fill was placed over the impacted soil to bring the remedial excavations up to grade. In 1993 an unknown amount of petroleum was manually removed from the groundwater surface from one monitoring well. The Site is currently monitored with a network of seven groundwater monitoring wells and five soil gas wells. The primary chemicals of concern include petroleum-related and chlorinated hydrocarbons in soil, groundwater, and soil vapor. To date, there have been no significant cleanup activities at the Site.  The Site is under regulatory oversight of the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH).     Cleanup is proposed consisting of excavation to remove contaminated soil from the Site, beginning in Summer 2022.     ACDEH is accepting comments on the planned cleanup through the end of February 2022.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site is developed as a warehouse and distribution center for The Salvation Army (TSA) and is in the characterization phase of investigation.  In November 2010, two USTs, a 10,000-gallon diesel and an 8,000-gallon gasoline tank, were removed with the oversight of Oakland Fire Dept. personnel.  Discolored soil and obvious petroleum odor was noted in the pit excavation.  Samples recovered from the tank pit were reported to include up to 17,000 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg)  and 300 mg\/kg benzene. Diesel and  MTBE were not detected at the site.   This case was opened in October 2011 following submittal of the UST removal report documenting a release had occurred.     The 10,000-gallon diesel and an 8,000-gallon gasoline USTs are second generation tanks.  Previous USTs were removed circa 2000.  A strong odor emanated from the tank pit, so it was left open to aerate prior to the installation of the second generation USTs.  No record of tank condition or sampling was found for the first generation tanks in the files.    Initial soil and groundwater investigation performed in January 2014 with the advance of 7 soil bores- three in the former tank pit with 4 bores forming a transect along the SSW side if the pit.  No soil samples were collected within 10 feet of the ground surface.   Maximum soil concentrations within the pit were near the northwest corner (SB7 @ 20’) with TPHg: 8,900 mg\/kg, total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd): 41 mg\/kg, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (collectively BTEX): 64, 260, 170, &amp; 610 mg\/kg, &amp; 12 mg\/kg methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE).  Maximum soil concentrations along transect were located in a western bore (SB3 @ 20’) at TPHg: 9,400 mg\/kg, TPHd: 120 mg\/kg, BTEX: 110, 380, 240, &amp; 890 mg\/kg, &amp; &lt;2.0 mg\/kg MTBE.      Maximum grab groundwater (GGW) concentrations within the pit were reported for SB1 with TPHg: 210,000 micrograms per liter (ug\/L) (x8015), BTEX (x8015): 35,000, 47,000 3,000, &amp; 16,000 ug\/L, respectively, &amp; 240 ug\/L (x8260) MTBE; and maximum GGW concentrations along transect were reported for SB4, the western most soil bore, at TPHg: 280,000 ug\/L (x8015), BTEX (x8015): 35,000, 30,000 3,900, &amp; 20,000 ug\/L &amp; 5,300 ug\/L (x8260) MTBE. Note: no water was recovered in SB3.    Three on-site and one off-site wells installed in October 2015 for GW investigation.  Most recent groundwater monitoring event (2-12-2019) reported up to 1,900 ug\/L benzene, 160 ug\/L ethylbenzene and 68 ug\/L naphthalene.  Skimmers operational in two wells and sheen consistently reported in two of the 3 on-site wells &amp; intermittent in other well.  Down gradient extent of the plume not defined.   Investigation underway (Summer 2020).",

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at https:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The facility is developed and currently operating as an active trucking facility.   Between the years 1987 to 1996, three underground USTs were  removed and two USTs were abandoned-in-place at the Site.  In April 1996, the remaining 10,000 gallon diesel UST and all associated piping was removed from the central-eastern area of the Site.  In September 2000,  three groundwater monitoring wells (MW-3, MW-4, and MW-5) were installed around the location of the removed USTs in the central-eastern area of the Site.  In December 2007, Burns &amp; McDonnell initiated subsurface characterization at the Site, which consisted of nine direct push borings, initiated due to a pending property transaction.  Improperly constructed wells were decommissioned and re-installed in 2008.      In October, 2011 the two abandoned-in-place USTs and an oil-water separator were removed .  Post excavation confirmation soil samples documented  COCs remain in the subsurface, including 104 mg\/kg TPHg (SW-4 @ 3.6'), 5,930 mg\/kg TPH (SW-4 @ 3.6'), and  1,990 mg\/kg zinc OSW NEA-3 @ 3').  Grab groundwater from the tank pits revealed up to 598 ug\/L TPHg, benzene to 5.2 ug\/L, 2,250 ug\/L TPHd, and 368 ug\/L TPHmo. Cd, Cr, Pb, NI and Zn concentrations were reported at up to 14.7 ug\/L, 866 ug\/L, 2,050 ug\/L, 1,010 ug\/L, and 3,070 ug\/L, respectively.  Cr, Pb, Ni, &amp; Zn GW concentrations exceed ESLs.  Grab groundwater from the oil-water seperator revealed 2,990 ug\/L TPHd, and 1,970 ug\/L TPHmo.  MTBE was reported to 0.87 ug\/L.    A Phase II investigation conducted by ACC revealed concentrations of TPHd up to 370 mg\/kg (SB-22 @ 1.0-1.5') and lead (concentrations up to 14,000 mg\/kg) (SB-21 @ 1.0-1.5') remains in shallow soil beneath the site.  Additionally, naphthalene  concentrations were reported up 0.029 mg\/kg and the PAH BaPe concentrations up to 1.32 mg\/kg were reported.  Grab groundwater from the Ph II revealed  240 ug\/L TPHg, 19,000 ug\/L TPHd, and 1,970 ug\/L TPHmo.  MTBE was reported to 2.8 ug\/L.  BTEX compounds were reported at concentrations below their respective reporting limits.",

A copy of the Assessor’s Map that is current as of the date of this letter is provided as Attachment A of this letter. The Site is currently being developed by Holland Partner Group (Holland) with a 19-story, 437-unit residential tower with podium style parking and approximately 16,000 square feet of retail space. The residential tower and parking structure will each include one below-grade level. ACDEH understands that historic on-site structures and improvements have been demolished and that the site is currently being excavated and dewatered as part of planned development activities. The Site is planned to be excavated to a maximum total depth of approximately 20 feet below ground surface (ftbgs). Groundwater at the Site has historically been encountered at a depth of approximately 7-ftbgs. The last updated Conceptual Site Model (CSM) was provided in the Site Management Plan dated September 18, 2018 which was prepared by Northgate Environmental Management, Inc. (Northgate) on behalf of Holland.  The Site is currently regulated by ACDEH under the authority of a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement (VRAA) which was executed by ACDEH and Holland Partner Group (Holland) on June 19, 2018. The Site is being regulated due to the presence of the following constituents of concern (COCs):  1. Metals in soil, culvert sediment, culvert water, and groundwater;   2. Poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil and culvert sediment, predominantly in the shallow (5-ftbgs or less) soil culvert sediment. Specific PAHs identified include:   A. bis(2-chloroisopropyl)ether  B. Benzo[a]pyrene;  C. Ideno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene;  D. Dibenz[a,h]anthracene; and  E. Benzo[b]fluoranthene;  3. Petroleum hydrocarbons, predominantly diesel range, but including gasoline range and oil range and benzene, toluene, ethylebenzene, and xylenes (collectively, “BTEX”), and naphthalene.",

The confirmation sample at the base of the excavation contained 448 mg\/kg TPHho, and similar concentrations of BTEX.    On August 3, 2010, soil bores SB-1 and SB-2 were installed at the site.  Bedrock was encountered at 11 and 6 feet below grade surface (bgs).  No PID detections were encountered in both bores.  Two soil samples were collected; both were non-detectable for TPHho and BTEX.  Groundwater was encountered at a depth of 16.5 feet in SB-2, and a sample was collected.  Insufficient volume was present to conduct analysis for TPHho; however, sufficient volume was present to analyze from TPHdro (carbon range C9 – C23) by micro-extraction techniques, as well as BTEX and MTBE.  All analytes were nondetectable.  Soil vapor probes (SGP-1 and SGP-2) were installed immediately adjacent to the former UST location and soil gas samples were collected at a depth of 5 feet bgs.

In 2107 through 2018, the site was excavated to a depth of 23 feet below ground surface which included the removal of approximately 8 feet of fill material, all vadose zone soil (0 to 12 feet below ground surface), and approximately 11 feet of the saturated zone. In addition to excavation, construction dewatering was conducted from April 2018 to November 2018.     Due to the historic presence of tetrachloroethene in groundwater beneath the Site at concentrations that exceed the applicable vapor intrusion environmental screening level, a combination water and vapor barrier (CETCO COREFLEX) was installed throughout the footprint of the building.",

In 1986 tank basin soil and a groundwater sample were collected during the replacement of USTs in a pre-existing tank basin; hydrocarbon concentrations were encountered.  Sixteen soil vapor wells are reported to have been installed in 1986 and 1987 over the BART tube, located directly below the site; however, no data has been submitted.  In 1992 a groundwater sample was collected from a former vadose zone well (VW-2) and concentrations of concern were encountered; however, the location of VW-2-1 is unknown.  In July 1994 product lines were removed and upgraded and low hydrocarbon concentrations were encountered.  In March 2000 eight hand-augered bores were installed at the site; most bore depths were limited to 10 feet by the presence of the BART tube.  In Mach 2002 wells MW-1 to MW-3 were installed on either side of the BART tube and right-of-way.  In April 2012 soil bores B-9 to B-12 were installed to define the downgradient extent of the dissolved-phase groundwater plume.  Groundwater was collected; however, appeared to define a deeper non-impacted groundwater zone.  The groundwater plume was defined using the LTCP groundwater technical justification paper 90th percentile plume length, and conducting a downgradient sensitive receptor survey for water supply wells and potential basements that might encounter the impacted groundwater.",

The soil samples were collected at a depth of approximately 6 feet bgs and contained up to 1,600 mg\/kg TPHd (northeast sample).  GW observed entering pit at a depth of about 6.5 feet bgs.  The pit water sample contained 1,800 ug\/L TPHd.  The pit was backfilled with clean fill.  One well installed adjacent to tank pit in 1996.  If the second well requested by ACDEH was installed, it may have been paved over.   Two monitoring events performed in 1996 with up to 2,800 ug\/L TPHd reported.  Efforts were made to determine the existence of the second well- it was not located.  A soil &amp; GW investigation was performed in 2019 revealed TPHd impacts to soil and groundwater.  No volatiles were identified.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site was a Shell service station from 1960 to 1999.  The USTs were removed in 1999 and the site is currently a 24-7 Quick Mart store.  Surrounding land use is mixed commercial and residential.  Two generations of USTs were known to be located at the site.  The first generation USTs were located in the northwest portion of the site and were removed sometime around 1983.  The second generation USTs, which were removed in 1999, were located near the southern corner of the site.      In response to the discovery of gasoline-saturated soil in a horizontal boring for an electrical service conduit six groundwater monitoring wells were installed at the site in May 1983.  No soil or groundwater samples were apparently collected from the monitoring well borings during well installation.  Fuel system testing results confirmed a leak in product lines.  The leak was repaired and new leak detectors installed.    In December 1998, the six monitoring wells were developed and sampled.  Based on elevated concentrations of fuel hydrocarbons and MTBE detected in the groundwater samples, an Unauthorized Release Form was submitted on December 23, 1998.  The three 10,000-gallon USTs and associated piping and dispensers were removed in July 1999.  Soil samples collected beneath the USTs, dispensers, and piping contained up to 6.4 ppm of MTBE.   Following removal of the UST system in July 1999, service station operations were discontinued at the site.      A conduit study was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2000.   The locations and depths of utilities including sanitary sewers and storm drained were reviewed using City of Oakland utility maps.  The conduit study concluded that sewer lines were, at times, below groundwater levels and potentially could act as preferential pathways during periods of higher groundwater elevations.     In April 2001, three soil borings were advanced in Bancroft Avenue downgradient from the site.   MTBE was detected in one soil sample at a concentration of 0.055 ppm and in one of two grab groundwater samples collected at a concentration of 450 ppb.  A door-to-door well survey was conducted at the site in August 2001.  No water wells were identified within 500 feet of the site.  However, one active irrigation well was identified approximately 1,300 feet downgradient from the site.  A water sample was collected from the irrigation well on November 10, 2004.  MTBE was not detected in the water sample from the backyard irrigation well.      On July 13, 2006, two soil borings were advanced downgradient from the site.  Soil boring SB-2 was advanced to a depth of 30 feet bgs; however, no groundwater was encountered even though the boring was left open for more than four hours.  Groundwater sampling was attempted every three feet from 7 to 25 feet bgs in soil boring SB-1.  No groundwater was encountered in any of the intervals.  Based on the decline in on-site fuel hydrocarbon concentrations, lack of water-bearing layers encountered in the on-site borings, and previous off-site sampling results, no further off-site investigation was considered necessary.      Groundwater was sampled quarterly in the six monitoring wells at the site from December 1998 to May 2007.  MTBE was detected at elevated concentrations from December 1998 to 2001 in well MW-4, which is downgradient from the most recent UST system removed in 1999.  MTBE concentrations detected in groundwater from 26,000 ppb in December 1998 to 16 ppb in June 2004.  During the most recent groundwater sampling event on September 19, 2008, MTBE was detected at a concentration of 2.4 ppb in groundwater from well MW-4.       In June 2008, three soil borings (TB-1 through TB-3) were advanced in the area of the first generation USTs.  TPH as gasoline was detected in 3 of the six soil samples collected at concentrations up to 440 ppm.  BTEX and fuel oxygenates were not detected in any of the soil samples.  TPH as motor oil was detected in the soil disposal sample.    Based onthe results of the June 2008 soil borings, five additional soil borings were advanced in the area of the second generation USTs in February 2009.  TPH as gasoline was detected in 4 of 25 soil samples collected at concentrations up to 250 ppm in the area of the second generation USTs.  TPH as diesel and TPH as motor oil were detected at concentrations up to 1,200 ppm and TPH as motor oil was detected at concentrations up to 1,200 and 1,700 ppm, respectively.     TPH as gasoline was detected in grab groundwater samples from 4 of the 5 soil borings advanced in February 2009 at concentrations up to 110,000 ppb.  MTBE and benzene were detected in one of the 5 grab groundwater samples at concentrations of 1.2 and 17 ppb, respectively.  Based on data from the surrounding sampling locations, the detection of 110,000 ppb of TPH as gasoline in the grab groundwater sample from boring SB-4 may represent a localized area of gasoline-contaminated soil and may be biased high.  A grab groundwater sample collected from boring SB-3, which is located approximately 27 feet north of SB-4 did not contain TPH as gasoline at concentrations above the reporting limit.  Groundwater samples collected from nearby monitoring wells contained significantly lower concentrations of TPH as gasoline.  A groundwater sample collected on September 19, 2008 from monitoring well MW-6, which is located approximately 35 feet downgradient from boring SB-4 contained 120 ppb of TPH as gasoline.  A groundwater sample collected on September 19, 2008 from monitoring well MW-2, which is located approximately 15 feet crossgradient from boring SB-4 did not contain TPH as gasoline at a concentration above the reporting limit.    TPH as diesel was detected at a concentration of 300,000 ppb in a grab groundwater sample from boring SB-4 on 02\/06\/2009; however, this result likely represents a localized area of contaminated soil in the area of the former first generation USTs.  The grab groundwater sample result may also be biased high due to elevated turbidity.    Two soil vapor samples were collected from the area of the former first generation tank pit on February 5, 2009.  Benzene was detected in the two soil vapor samples at concentrations of 13 and 21 micrograms per cubic meter, respectively.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site, which is 2.7-acres in size, is comprised of two adjacent parcels with addresses of 4600 and 4700 Coliseum Way in Oakland, CA.  Buildings at the site consist of two smaller metal-framed warehouses in the western portion of the site and a large warehouse building in the center of the site.  The two metal-framed warehouses in the western portion of the site were constructed between 1913 and 1925 for use as storage facilities for feed and coal.  A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) dated October 22, 2007 and prepared by AEI Consultants, indicates that the warehouses have historically been used for wooden molding operations, insulation manufacturing, and cabinet making.  Currently, the warehouses are used for storage of miscellaneous equipment and construction supplies.  The large metal warehouse in the central portion of the site was constructed in 1968 for use by Bostrom Bergen Manufacturing for use as a metal manufacturing facility.  Bostrom occupied the site from 1969 through 2000.  The large warehouse building is currently occupied by Cable Moore, Inc., which manufactures wire rope, cable, rigging, and safety construction equipment.  Surrounding land use is commercial\/industrial.    This case closure summary addresses three environmental conditions at the site:  1) VOC-contaminated soil beneath a former shed located northeast of the large warehouse building.  2) Red-stained soil containing elevated concentrations of metals northeast of the large warehouse building.  3) An underground storage tank (UST) located in the western portion of the site.    VOC-Contaminated Soil beneath Former Shed    Based on the results of a Phase I ESA by AEI Consultants dated October 22, 2007, three soil borings were advanced in the northeastern portion of the site to evaluate potential migration of contaminants onto the site from off-site locations and two soil borings were advanced in the area of a former gasoline UST.  The VOCs 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) and its degradation products were detected in groundwater in the northeastern portion of the site at concentrations up to 1,200 ppb.  Low concentrations of toluene were detected in groundwater in the area of the former gasoline tank.      In June and July 2008, 15 soil borings were advanced in the area of the former shed in the northeastern portion of the site to evaluate whether soil beneath the shed was the source of VOCs detected in groundwater.  The VOCs 1,1-DCE, 1,1-DCA, and 1,1,1-TCA were detected in soil with the highest concentrations detected in the immediate vicinity of the shed.  Low concentrations of VOCs were detected in soil samples collected outside the immediate vicinity of the shed.  Based on the results of these investigations, soil was excavated to a depth of approximately 5.5 feet bgs from an area beneath the former shed.  Soil excavation was conducted in three slot trenches from April 8 through April 10, 2009.  Analytical results from verification sidewall and bottom samples indicated that the VOC-affected soil with concentrations exceeding ESLs were removed from the area of the former shed.    Red-stained Soil Northeast of the Large Warehouse Building     In 2002, Kleinfelder prepared an ESA that identified red-stained soil in the “painting area in the rear of the site.”  Based on the observations in the ESA, four soil samples were collected in 2003 from the red-stained soil at the rear of the site and analyzed for metals.  Maximum concentrations of metals in the four soil samples were 8.3 ppm for cadmium, 1,100  ppm for chromium, 4,500 ppm for lead, 130 ppm for nickel, and 18,000 ppm for zinc.  Based on these results, the red-stained soil was excavated to a depth of 12 inches on June 12 and 18, 2003.  Approximately 226 tons of soil classified as “California hazardous” and 159 tons of “RCRA hazardous” soil was removed from an area measuring 140 by 40 feet.  Following the excavation, four confirmation soil samples were collected and analyzed for lead.  Total lead concentrations in the four confirmation samples ranged from 42 to 130 ppm.      On March 27, 2009, 23 soil borings were advanced in the northeastern portion of the site to evaluate whether the soil with elevated concentrations of metals was sufficiently delineated and remediated.  Select soil samples from 16 of the 23 soil borings were analyzed for lead and zinc.  During a second phase of investigation on April 3, 2009, near surface soil samples were collected at locations B-37 through B-40 to further delineate the lateral extent of elevated zinc detected in the vicinity of boring B-31 in the overhead crane area.  Elevated concentrations of zinc were not detected in soil samples collected in close proximity to B-31.  Excavation and removal was not considered necessary based on these results.  The overhead crane area including B-31 was covered with concrete as part of facility improvements.    Between April 10 and May 20, 2009, near surface soil samples were collected at 10 additional locations (B-41 through B-50) to assess the lateral extent of elevated lead and zinc associated with red-stained soil in the vicinity of the former shed northeast of the large warehouse building.      The shed, including the 12 by 20 foot concrete pad for the shed, was removed in April 2009.  Red-stained soil in the area of the former shed was excavated on April 9, 2009 and May 21, 2009.  Soil excavation, which was based on visual observation and analytical results from samples collected in the area of the former shed, extended to the northeastern property boundary.  Based on analytical results, the vertical extent of the excavation was extended to the top of native soil, which was typically encountered at depths of 8 to 12 inches.  Soil with concentrations exceeding the target cleanup goals (ESLs for commercial land use) was removed during the excavation activities with two exceptions.  A small quantity soil containing zinc at a concentration exceeding the target cleanup goal was left in place in the area of B-31; the area was covered with a concrete pad.  A small quantity of soil containing lead and zinc was left in place in the area of samples B-49 and B-50.      Gasoline Tank    A 6,000-gallon gasoline tank was noted in the northwest portion of the site on historical Sanborn maps (1952 and 1966).  Two soil borings were advanced in the area of the gasoline tank in January 2008.  Toluene was detected at low concentrations (less than 2 ppb) in grab groundwater samples from the two soil borings (B4 and B5).  TPHg, benzene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes were not detected in grab groundwater samples from the two borings.  In correspondence dated March 13, 2009, ACEH requested that a geophysical investigation be conducted in the suspected area of the gasoline tank to assess whether the tank remained in place.  A geophysical survey conducted on April 8, 2009 identified a large subsurface metal object with a signature consistent with a UST.  Excavation activities revealed that the UST had a capacity of approximately 1,100 gallons.  Approximately 900 gallons of liquid were removed and disposed off-site.  The UST was removed on May 19, 2009.  Two soil samples collected from the tank pit contained TPHd and TPHmo at maximum concentrations of 7 and 56 ppm, respectively.  TPHg was not detected in soil at concentrations above the reporting limit.  A grab groundwater sample collected from the tank pit contained TPHg at a concentration of 68 ppb and did not contain TPHd and TPHmo at concentrations above the reporting limit.  Based on the limited extent and concentrations of fuel hydrocarbons observed in the area of the former tank, no further action was required.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    The site is located at the corner of MacArthur Boulevard and Magee Street in Oakland, CA. Surrounding land is mixed commercial and residential.  Previously, the site was a Chevron service station until 2004 when it was re-branded to as a Valero service station.  The property has reportedly been occupied by a service station since 1946.  The station was previously equipped with two hydraulic hoists in the service area, two 7,500-gallon and one 3,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs), one 1,000-gallon waste oil UST, and two dispenser islands.  In 1984, the former steel gasoline and waste oil USTs were replaced with three 10,000-gallon fiberglass gasoline USTs and one 1,000-gallon fiberglass UST.  No documentation of this event was submitted.    The topography of the site slopes gently towards the southwest.  Soils at the site are characterized as alluvial deposits, consisting primarily of interbedded layers of clayey, silty, and sandy soils with varying amounts of clay, silt, sand, and gravel to the maximum explored depth of 45 feet below ground surface (bgs).    In January 1993, three soil samples (TR-1 through TR-3) were collected from a PG&amp;E excavation on the sidewalk near the southern corner of the site.  A grab groundwater sample (TR-4) was also collected from groundwater encountered at three feet bgs in the approximately four foot deep excavation trench.  The soil samples contained up to 7 parts per million (ppm) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg).  The grab groundwater sample contained 2,500 parts per billion (ppb) TPHg and 390 ppb benzene.    On April 19, 1994, one 1,000-gallon fiberglass waste oil tank was excavated and replaced at a new location on the site.  No obvious holes or leaks were observed during the tank replacement.  Soil samples were collected from the tank excavation pit (WO-N and WO-S) and soil stockpiles.  Groundwater was encountered at approximately six feet bgs and one grab groundwater sample was collected from the waste oil excavation pit.   No detectable concentrations of TPHg, TPHd, TOG, BTEX, chlorinated volatile organic compounds, or semi-volatile organic compounds were present in soil and in groundwater in the UST removal confirmation samples.  Up to 180 ppm TOG, 540 ppm TPHg, 1.1 ppm benzene, and 9.2 ppm ethylbenzene were documented in the stockpile samples.    On April 26, 1994 the product lines to the gasoline USTs were replaced and product line trench (P-1 through P-6) samples were collected.  Detectable contaminant concentrations were found in the product line trench at concentrations up to 1,200 ppm TPHg, 2.2 ppm benzene, and 3.4 ppm ethylbenzene at a depth of 3.5 feet bgs.  On May 2 and 5, 1994, the product line trenches were over-excavated to remove residual petroleum hydrocarbons.  Soil samples collected during over-excavation activities contained up to 1,300 ppm TPHg, 6 ppm benzene, and 33 ppm ethylbenzene at a depth of 5 feet bgs.  As with the initial product line removal excavation soil results, soil samples collected beneath the northern end of the western dispenser contained the highest concentrations of hydrocarbons.  A subsequent soil bore (B-16) defined the vertical extent of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination at this location (see below).    The gasoline USTs were also upgraded in the 1994 site renovation work and that approximately 25,000 gallons of groundwater were pumped from the excavation and disposed of offsite.    On March 18, 1996, wells MW-1, MW-2, and MW-3 were installed to depths of 30, 35, and 45 fbgs.  Twenty-two soil samples were collected from the borings at five-foot intervals and at intervals where soil contamination appeared to be present.  Groundwater samples were collected from the completed monitoring wells on April 4, 1996.  Soil concentrations up to 400 ppm TPHg, 0.62 ppm toluene, and 4.7 ppm ethylbenzene were detected.  No benzene was detected in soil.  The only petroleum hydrocarbon detection in groundwater was MTBE from well MW-2 at a concentration of 6,100 ppb.  In 1999, a preferential pathway study identified a gas line, electrical line, and cable line beneath the sidewalk bordering the site along MacArthur Boulevard.  These utilities were estimated to all be above four feet bgs.  An electrical line also extends from the site’s station building towards the southern corner of the property.  A sanitary sewer (depth of 6 feet), storm drain (depth of 6 to 7 feet), and water line (depth of 3 to 3.5 feet), are present beneath Magee Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard.  The study concluded that the sanitary sewer, storm, and water lines could be preferential pathways, since their depths were within the known range of groundwater depth (2.67 to 10.21 feet bgs).  Low onsite grab groundwater and groundwater concentrations appear to indicate limited potential for a significant offsite groundwater contaminant plume.    On July 29 and 30, 2003, eight soil borings (B-1 and B-3 through B-9) were advanced to total depths between 6 and 10.5 feet bgs.  Groundwater was encountered in the borings between 3 and 10 feet bgs.  Soil samples were collected from the borings above the water table and at approximately 9 to 9.5 feet bgs.  Grab groundwater samples were collected from all borings.   TPHg and MTBE were detected in soil at concentrations up to 3.3 ppm and 0.13 ppm, respectively, at a depth of 2 and 9.5 feet, respectively.  The grab groundwater sample collected from boring B-8 contained the highest concentrations of 5,200 ppb TPHg, 3 ppb benzene, and 980 ppb MTBE at an approximate depth of 10 feet bgs.  Grab groundwater samples collected from borings B-4 and B-7 also contained MTBE at concentrations of 420 and 460 ppb, respectively.    On December 14, 2006, six bores were attempted, but only one boring (B-11) was completed to the total depth of 24 feet bgs.   Underground utilities and subsurface shallow refusal prevented the completion of the remaining five borings.  Boring B-11 is located near the northern corner of the site, upgradient from the current gasoline UST complex.  Groundwater was not encountered in boring B-11, and no grab groundwater sample was collected.  A total of five soil samples were collected at five-foot intervals beginning at five feet bgs.  The soil samples detected up to 0.002 ppm toluene and 0.33 ppm MTBE.  No other petroleum hydrocarbons were found in soil above detection limits.    On May 11 and 12, 2010, four offsite borings (B-12 through B-15) were advanced along MacArthur Boulevard across the street from the site to define the lateral extent of contamination.  An additional boring (B-16) was advanced onsite to determine the vertical extent of contamination previously detected in boring PX-8.  Grab groundwater samples were collected from each boring.  Soil samples collected from the borings contained up to 56 ppm TPHg and 0.004 ppm benzene at a depth of 7 feet bgs.  No detectable concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were present in soil or groundwater samples collected from onsite soil bore SB-16.  Grab groundwater collected from offsite boring B-15 contained the greatest constituent concentrations of 40,000 Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), 17,000 ppb TPHg, and 34 ppb benzene.  The only detection of MTBE in groundwater was 0.6 ppb, from boring B-14.    The former Scooter Wilson Auto Repair property at 3600 MacArthur Boulevard is also a leaking underground storage tank site (LOP Case No. RO0000280, GeoTracker ID T0600102113).  Dissolved phase concentrations of TPHg and TPHd detected in the grab groundwater sample from boring B-15 are suspected to be from the former diesel and gasoline USTs at the Scooter Wilson site.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "55-gallon drums containing waste oil were encountered in the east central portion of the site on July 14, 2006.  This location was adjacent to soil boring B-9 where petroleum hydrocarbons were previously detected in soil.  Stained soil was observed in the area of the drums and was excavated and stockpiled for disposal.  After excavation of the drums and soil, a confirmation soil sample from the base of the excavation was collected and did not contain TPH, VOCs, or fuel oxygenates at concentrations above reporting limits.  Metals concentrations in the confirmation soil sample were within background ranges.      To evaluate potential vapor intrusion for the existing building, soil vapor samples were collected at five locations below the sidewalk outside the northern and eastern perimeters of the building in January 2009.  Benzene was detected in 6 of 10 soil vapor samples collected at concentrations ranging from 5.8 to 92 micrograms per cubic meter (µg\/m3).   The concentrations of benzene in soil vapor exceeded the Environmental Screening Level (San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (2007, revised 2008) for residential land use of 84 µg\/m3 in 3 of the 10 soil vapor samples collected.       Subslab soil vapor samples were collected within the three residential units in the northeastern corner of the building.  Benzene was detected in each of the three sub-slab soil vapor samples at concentrations ranging from 11 to 16 µg\/m3.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Arcadia Park property is a former industrial site that has been approved for redeveloped into a residential complex. The site has been contaminated by previous industrial operations with metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and pesticides. The site has been divided into five areas (A through D) for the purpose of site environmental investigation and cleanup. Environmental investigation and remediation have been completed in Areas A, B, and C, and are underway in Areas D and E.    Area A previously contained a structure leased to a recycling business that was demolished prior to remediation. Area B previously was occupied by two buildings, one vacant, and the other leased to a dairy products business (Berkeley Farms). These buildings have been demolished. A fueling island and two diesel USTs were formerly located in the northern part of Area B, and were removed in 1995. Area C has been occupied by a warehouse used for storage by Bay Area Rapid Transit and Dreisbach Enterprises. Environmental investigation and cleanup activities were conducted in Areas A, B, and C mostly in 2006, and final tasks have been completed in 2008. Remediation of Areas A, B, and C included excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil that exceeded residential environmental screening levels. The entire Area A was excavated to depths between 1.5 to 3 feet to remove surface soil contaminated with lead. Three excavations were completed in area B: the largest in the vicinity of the former diesel tanks, and two smaller (10-foot-by-10-foot) to remove surface soil contaminated with pesticides and metals. A 10-foot-by-10-foot excavation was completed in Area C to remove nuisance concentrations of TPHd in shallow soil. Confirmation soil samples collected after excavation indicated that remedial goals were met. Approximately 20,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil have been removed from the site. In addition, approximately 64,000   gallons of groundwater were pumped out of UST overexcavation and disposed to the sanitary sewer.    There are no drinking water wells, or surface waters within ½ mile of the site. The industrial well present at the site was properly destroyed in May 2007. To mitigate potential human health risks associated with groundwater contamination a deed restriction was recorded prohibiting installation of water wells on the site. In addition, a vapor barrier will be placed beneath structures in the area of the former USTs as a conservative measure to prevent volatilization of vapor from subsurface to indoor air.        No Further Action letter has been issued for Areas a, B, and C on July 28, 2008, as the remnant contamination present beneath the subject site does not appear to pose a significant risk to human health and the environment, and is expected to naturally attenuate with time. Areas D and E are under remediation.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site History and Description of Corrective Actions:    The M&amp;N Warehouse (M&amp;N) facility occupied approximately four acres in the western-most portion of the 52-acre East Baybridge Center (EBC) redevelopment project.  M&amp;N consists of parcel APN 7-617-16-5 in the City of Oakland.  The site, as currently developed, consists of an approximately 110,000 square-foot single story commercial tilt-up structure with asphalt-paved parking on the east.  Prior to the EBC development M&amp;N operated an approximately 85,000 square-foot warehouse that was bounded by rail lines, sidings, and spurs to the north, south and west.  The warehouse was situated in western portion of an area designated as Area C of the pre-EBC development in an industrial and commercial area with a rail yard to the south operated by Oakland Terminal Railways.  The property is bounded on the west by Beach Street, on the north by Shellmound Street on the southeast by Mandela Parkway and a vacant parcel to the southwest.  The property is bounded on the east by a paved parking area for the EBC development along an extension of Hubbard Street.    The M&amp;N Trucking Warehouse (M&amp;N) property was owned by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe (AT&amp;SF) Railway Company.  Through mergers, acquisitions, and spinoffs, the AT&amp;SF transferred land holdings to a subsidiary, the Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corporation (SFPRC), and later to Catellus Development Corporation (Catellus), a SFPRC subsidiary.  Catellus became independent from SFPRC in 1990.  Catellus merged with ProLogis in 2005.  The project at the time of the ProLogis merger was identified as the “East Bay Bridge Shopping Center”.    The current owner as of March, 2011, is the East Bay Bridge Retail LLC.      The M&amp;N warehouse building was previously occupied (1911) by the Griffen &amp; Skelly Company fruit cannery.  At that time this area contained eight private wells, an oil tank, and was used for chemical storage.  The 1911 Sanborn Fire Insurance map depicts eight private wells on the M&amp;N site.  California Packing Corporation appears to have occupied the site from at least 1930 to the early 1950s.  The building was used as a warehouse in 1956 and 1964.  Sanborn notations indicate that chemicals and paint were stored at the site during the period 1930 to 1964.  More than 75 drums were reported viewed on the 1953 aerial photograph on the site east of the warehouse.  As of September 1989 M &amp; N Truck Lines leased the warehouse and was reported to store a variety of hazardous materials including acids, aromatic compounds, metal compounds, ketones and other substances.  M &amp; N Truck Lines sub-leased a portion of their facility to Arc Roofing.  A historical map provided by M &amp; N indicates a possible location of a 550-gallon underground storage tank (UST) in the northwest corner of the property. The warehouse was removed in 1990 in preparation of the EBC development.     Site cleanup criteria for the EBC project site were established with, and approved by, Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (ACHA), predecessor to the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) in January 1991 of 1,000 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) total oil and grease (TOG), 100 mg\/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd, 10 mg\/kg gasoline-range total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHg), and 1 mg\/kg benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene or toluene (BTEX) compounds (combined).  A 1992 revision to the clean up levels reduce the benzene concentration to non-detect.  The Total Threshold Limit Concentrations (TTLCs) were used for the cleanup levels for metals.  A remedial plan proposing the encapsulation of hydrocarbon contaminated soil for the EBC development was approved by the ACHA in a letter dated March 5, 1991.  The area designated for encapsulation was east of the M&amp;N facility in the EBC Area A and the southern portion of Area B.    Soil and groundwater investigations performed in 1989 and 1990, conducted for the East Baybridge project, identified an area in the eastern part of the M&amp;N property as having elevated metal concentrations including 8,800 mg\/kg lead and 47,100 mg\/kg zinc.  Further delineation of the area indicated the area extent of the metal impacts to be localized.  Approximately 120 cubic yards (cu yds) of metals-impacted soil was excavated and removed to a US Ecology facility near Beatty, Nevada for off-site disposal.  Six confirmation samples reporting lead up to 6.4 mg\/kg and zinc up to 41.1 mg\/kg.  The maximum metal concentrations left in place at the site were 400 mg\/kg lead and 990 mg\/kg zinc at a depth of 0.5-feet.    As part of the Phase II investigation for the project Levine- Fricke (LF) installed a groundwater monitoring well on the western side of the former M&amp;N site.  The well, identified as LF-12, was installed on February 12, 1990 in the vicinity of the suspected former oil UST that was identified on the 1911 Sanborne map.  Results of February 1990 groundwater sampling event for LF-12 revealed TPHd at a concentration of 500 micrograms per liter (g\/L).  No TPHg, TPH as oil (TPHo), or BTEX compounds were detected for the water sample.      An oily substance was encountered during a geotechnical investigation of the property in March 1992.  A soil sample recovered from a boring advance in the vicinity of the geotechnical boring was reported to contain 2,600 mg\/kg TPHo and 8,500 mg\/kg TOG.  A grab-groundwater sample from the boring was analyzed for TPHg, TPHd, TOG, and BTEX.  All compounds concentrations were below the laboratory reporting limit except for TPHd, which was reported at 300 g\/L.  An investigation determined the northwestern portion of the M&amp;N property contained TPHd, TPHo and\/or TOG concentrations exceeding the soil cleanup criteria.  Profiling the impacted soil identified the contaminant as crude oil.     Excavation of the contaminated soil commenced in August 1993.  On August 31, 1993, during the course of soil excavation, two 12,000-gallon USTs and associated piping were removed.  Though the ages of the tanks are unknown, both tanks were constructed of steel with riveted seams.  Several holes were observed in each tank.  The tanks were situated end-to-end.  The northern tank is designated as Tank 1.  Both of the tanks contained heating elements that are consistent with tanks storing very heavy fraction petroleum hydrocarbons such as bunker oil.  As the tanks were located in an area destined to be over-excavated, no side wall samples were collected.  Three samples were collected from beneath the tanks.  Two of the three samples were reported to contain TPHg at up to 31 mg\/kg and total xylenes up to 0.16 mg\/kg with BET concentrations below the laboratory reporting limit.  Diesel and motor oil were reported in one sample above the laboratory reporting limit with a concentration of 330 mg\/kg and 540 mg\/kg, respectively.  TOG was reported in two of the three samples at concentrations of 190 mg\/kg and 2,200 mg\/kg.  The samples were analyzed for the LUFT metals cadmium (Cd), chromium, (Cr) nickel (Ni) lead (Pb) and Zinc (Zn).  The LUFT metals were found at levels up to 0.49 mg\/kg, 24.6 mg\/kg, 48.0 mg\/kg, 4.8 mg\/kg, and 38.8 mg\/kg, for Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively.  The three of the samples were analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using EPA method 8010.  One sample was reported to contain two VOCs, cis-1,2-dichloroethene (c-1,2-DCE) and trichloroethene (TCE), at 0.0044 mg\/kg and 0.0049 mg\/kg, respectively.  The other compounds were below their respective reporting limits for the three base samples.    Approximately 6,000 cu yds of impacted soil was excavated from the site.  Approximately 4,300 cy were incorporated into the off-site containment area located at Area A and the southern portion of Area B of the EBC development.  The remaining 1,700 cu yds of soil were aerated and returned to the excavation after confirmation sampling revealed the residual concentrations were below the re-use criteria.  Sidewall and base excavation confirmation sampling demonstrated the residual chemical concentrations were below the cleanup guidelines for all but a stretch of sidewall along the western property margin where an estimated 90 cu yd of soil was left in place to prevent undermining of the sidewalk and telephone pole in this area.  Residual TPHd concentrations left in place below 7.5 feet bgs along the western sidewall were reported at up to 710 mg\/kg.  During the course of the excavation activities, groundwater monitoring well LF-12 was decommissioned.  A steel-cased water supply well encountered during the remedial activities was also decommissioned.  Prior to excavation backfill ponded groundwater was transferred to a surface tank pending disposal.  A profile of the water indicated TPH and BTEX levels were within the soil re-use guidelines.  The RWCB authorized the reuse of the water for moisture conditioning and dust control at the site.      In August 1994 a UST having an approximate capacity of 550 gallons was encountered in the eastern site area.  The tank was half-full of gravel.  The tank was removed on August 11, 1994.  Soil sampling associated with the tank removal revealed the presence of up to 140 mg\/kg of extractable range petroleum hydrocarbons.  The UST was presumed to be a heating oil tank.    Groundwater monitoring at the M&amp;N site consisted of perimeter down-gradient groundwater monitoring well LF-12, installed in February 1990 in the northwestern site area.  Monitoring wells LF-33, LF-34 and LF-35 were installed in early 1994.  Monitoring well LF-34 was located near the southwest corner of the property and LF-35 mid-way along the southern property boundary.  Monitoring well LF-33 was located west of the site across Beach Street.  The four monitoring wells were decommissioned in June 1994 in preparation of site development activities.  Replacement wells MW-12R and MW-34R were installed in December 1995 in the approximate locations of LF-12 and LF-34, respectively.  Two soil borings were advanced in the western portion of the site in conjunction with the installation of MW-12R.  The borings were advanced west of the former locations of the 12,000-gallon USTs.  Grab groundwater samples associated with the two borings were reported to contain TPHg concentrations up to 520 µg\/L and TPHd and TPHo to 3,800 ug\/L and 3,400 µg\/L, respectively.  TPH concentrations in soil from the borings were reported at up to 20 mg\/kg TPHg, 3,400 mg\/kg TPHd, and 3,400 mg\/kg TPHo.  The BTEX compounds were reported below the laboratory reporting limits for both the soil and groundwater samples     Groundwater at the site has been reported to have contained up to 500 µg\/L TPHg in a groundwater sample recovered from monitoring well LF-12, located adjacent to and down gradient of the location the former southern 12,000-gallon UST.  A grab-groundwater sample collected from the former tank pit was reported to contain TPHd at 970 µg\/L and TPHo at a concentration of 890 µg\/L.  TPHg was not detected in the well MW-12R and not analyzed for well MW-34R.  The BTEX compounds were reported below the laboratory reporting limits for the monitoring events during which the BTEX compounds were analyzed.   The replacement wells were decommissioned in March 2004.  Depth to water (dtw) measurements ranged from 9.66-feet to 12.97 feet btoc between December 1995 and  the final groundwater sampling event in December 2001.    A baseline health risk assessment for the EBC Area C, including the Bay Area Warehouse (BAW), Santa Fe Terminal Services- Area C (SFTS-C) and M&amp;N warehouse facilities, was performed in May 1994.  The study was focused on VOCs, SVOCs, TPH and the priority pollutant metals in soil and groundwater.  The risk assessment considered two scenarios: a construction worker scenario and a future retail store worker scenario.  For the construction worker scenario, a hazard index (HI) for inhalation of chemical vapors, ingestion of soil, and dermal contact with soil were 2.37, 2.26E-2, and 6.06E-3, respectively. The estimated inhalation hazard was calculated with toluene contributing 87% of the hazard, using the chronic reference dose.  The inhalation hazard HI becomes less than one when using the subchronic reference dose.  For future retail store workers, the HI for inhalation was estimated to be 1.61E-1 and 5.89E-2 for the estimated current and future air concentrations, respectively.  The priority pollutant metals were excluded from the retail worker scenario.  It was stated in the report that no significant health risks associated with the proposed development of Area C as a retail shopping center were identified by the health risk assessment.      An evaluation of the potential toxicity of residual TPH concentrations was performed for the EBC Area C, including the BAW, SFTS-C and M&amp;N warehouse facilities, The evaluation was performed in September 1994.  The study evaluated the adverse health risks for construction workers exposed to TPH in soil.  The study focused on the heavy fraction TPH- TPHo and TOG not covered in the earlier baseline health risk assessment.  As the site is to be capped with a low permeable cover, eliminating the potential for exposure, the study evaluated the exposure scenario for dermal contact and incidental oral intake for construction workers.  It was calculated the maximum concentration of TPH in soil that would not be expected to result in adverse health effects would be 19,165 mg\/kg of “heavy fraction” (crude oil and TOG- range) TPH.  The residual TOG concentrations for Area C are significantly lower than the calculated maximum exposure concentration.  The report findings concluded any localized areas of TPH in soil exceeding cleanup levels would not be expected to produce adverse health effects in outdoor workers during construction activities.    The VOCs 1,2-DCE and TCE have been detected in groundwater at the well LF-12 at concentrations of 67 µg\/L and 8 µg\/L, respectively.  The VOC 1,2 DCE has also been reported in five of the 13 sampling events conducted for MW-12R concentrations up to 4 µg\/L.  TCE Levels in MW-12R were above the laboratory reporting limit in four of the 13 sampling events at concentrations up to 3 µg\/L.  MW-12R was reported to contain 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA) in seven of the 13 sampling events at concentrations up to 5.9 µg\/L.  Neither 1,2-DCE, TCE, or1,1-DCA were reported in MW-12R in the final year of sampling (2001).  The VOC 1,2 DCE has been reported in 10 of the 13 sampling events conducted for MW-34R at concentrations up to 5 µg\/L. TCE Levels in MW-34R were reported in all 13 sampling events at concentrations up to 36 µg\/L.  MW-34R was reported to contain 1,1-dichloroethylene (1,1-DCE) in nine of the 13 sampling events at concentrations up to 4.1 µg\/L.  In the final year of sampling (2001) groundwater from MW-34R was reported to contain concentrations of TCE, 1,1-DCE and 1,2-DCE at 10 µg\/L, 2.9 µg\/L, and 2.2 µg\/L, respectively.  The RWQCB provided oversight of VOCs at the greater EBC redevelopment project as part of case 01S0226.  The RWQCB was of the opinion VOCs in this area of the EBC at the sight were from an off-site source.  As the RWQCB was the lead for site VOCs, VOCs at the site are not considered in this case closure.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is located on the northern corner of the intersection of 75th Avenue and Snell Street in an industrial area of Oakland, CA.  A commercial business currently operates from the two site buildings.      On September 15, 1996, three USTs (8,000-gallon gasoline, 1,000-gallon gasoline, and 500-gallon gasoline) were removed.  Five soil samples and one grab groundwater sample were collected from the UST excavation.  Total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), benzene, and MTBE were detected in the soil samples at concentrations up to 4,300 ppm, 13 ppm, and 25 ppm, respectively.  The excavation was not backfilled in 1996.  Soils from the excavation were stockpiled in the northern portion of the site for aeration and later used to backfill the excavation in March 2000.    In October 1997, soil and groundwater samples were collected from six soil borings (BH-1 through BH-6).  In June 1999, four groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-4) were installed.    Additional soil was removed from the tank excavation in March 2000.  The excavation was extended to a size of 29 feet by 48 feet and a depth of 8 to 11.5 feet.  During the excavation activities, an additional 500-gallon UST was discovered at the eastern end of the excavation.  Following the removal of the 500-gallon UST, a total of six soil samples were collected from the sidewalls and bottom of the excavation.  Pea gravel was placed in the excavation below the water table with the remainder of the excavation filled with the stockpiled and aerated soils from the 1996 tank removal.    On October 9 and 10, 2003, eight soil borings (SB-7 through SB-14) were advanced on site and adjacent properties.  Boring SB-14 was advanced to a depth of 30 feet bgs to assess whether the lower aquifer (termed the Deeper Zone in site reports) had been impacted by the fuel release.  A grab groundwater sample collected from a gravel layer at a depth of 29 feet bgs in boring SB-14 contained 2,300 ppb of TPHg, 72,000 ppb of TPH as diesel, and 120 ppb benzene indicating that the Deeper Zone was impacted.  In February 2006, five soil borings were advanced and completed as monitoring wells (MW-6 through MW-10).  One monitoring well (MW-6) was completed in the first water-bearing zone and the remaining wells (MW-7 through MW-10) were completed in the Deeper Zone.    In December 2006, two additional Deeper Zone monitoring wells (MW-11 and MW-12), one shallow zone sparging well (OZ-1), and seven dual level ozone sparging wells (OZ-2 through OZ-7) were installed.  The ozone sparging system was installed in February and March 2007 with system start up on March 8, 2007.  The system operated until August 28, 2009 when the system was shut down to assess whether groundwater concentrations would rebound to the higher concentration observed prior to operation of the ozone sparging system.  Groundwater monitoring data collected since August 2009 indicate that groundwater concentrations have remained stable at lower levels since shut down of the ozone sparging system.",

The former USTs are reported to have been installed in the mid-1980’s.  Wells MW-8A to MW-8D were installed in June 1988.  In September 1988 a soil gas survey was conducted.  In October 1988 soil bores B-1 to B-4 were installed.  In March 1989 bore B-5 was installed, MW-8D was destroyed, and wells MW-8F and MW-8G were installed.  In October 1989 bores B-8 to B-9 were installed.  In January 1990 bores B-10 to B-12 and wells MW-8H to MW-8K were installed.  Bores B-13 and B-14 are reported to have been installed in the second quarter 1990.  The waste oil UST was removed in September 1990 and an overexcavation of the area was conducted in October 1990.  In January 1991 a clay pipe previously used to convey waste oil to the waste oil UST was removed; the pipe was characterized as broken at the time of installation.  In April 1992 three 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs, two dispenser islands, and piping were removed from the site, and UST pit was overexcavated.  In May 1992 an overexcavation of the former dispenser area was conducted.  In August 1992 wells MW-8A and MW-8E were decommissioned.  In January 1993 the northern area of the site was excavated.  In April 1993 wells MW-8A and MW-8C were decommissioned.  In May 1993 wells MW-8K and MW-8L were installed.  Between December 1996 and March 2000 ORC socks were installed and periodically replaced in wells MW-8F, MW-8G, and MW-8I.  In November 2006 bores S-1 to S-3 were installed for a soil vapor investigation.  In March 2008 soil vapor bores SV-4 to SV-8 were installed, but due to shallow groundwater, vapor samples could not be collected; grab groundwater samples were instead collected.  Verification groundwater monitored was conducted in late 2009.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0003282 was opened by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) in November 2018 to provide regulatory oversight of the investigation and cleanup of subsurface contamination at the Site to facilitate redevelopment by Owow LLC.     The Site is located in a mixed residential and commercial area of Oakland and consists of three parcels (Alameda County Assessor Parcel Numbers (APN) 5-446-8-1 located at 2700 Magnolia Street; APN 5-446-1 located at 1173 28th Street;  and APN 5-446-1-2 located at 2715 Adeline Street. The collective Site is approximately 1.24 acres and comprised of a vacant 20,332-square foot, single-story warehouse; a concrete slab from a former building; and asphalt-paved hardscapes.    Conceptual plans include a mixed-use redevelopment consisting of a single story work\/live complex, including a parking garage with both subterranean and aboveground spaces, an elevator, and light manufacturing spaces on the ground floor in the eastern portion of the complex.       The Site is located at 2715 Adeline Street in Oakland, California. Other addresses associated with the Site include 1173 28th Street, 2700 Magnolia Street, and 2736 Magnolia Street. The Site is bounded by 28th Street to the north, Adeline Street to the east, commercial facilities to the south, and Magnolia Street to the west. The properties surrounding the Site include residential, mixed-use, and commercial purposes. Additionally, a high school and a health care facility are located approximately 350 feet and 1,300 feet, respectively, from the Site.    Based on historical information the Site was utilized for residential and commercial purposes. Between 1902 and 1911, the Site contained a single dwelling and an aboveground storage tank (AST) with unknown contents. Sometime before 1912, the Site was redeveloped. The former dwelling was replaced with two new dwellings and an automobile shop was constructed. In the mid 1920s, a laundry facility, known as Ambassador Laundry, was constructed on the northwest portion of the Site. In the early 1930s, an aluminum and bass foundry was constructed on southwest portion of the Site. Around this same time, two USTs, containing gasoline, were installed on the Site. By the mid-1930s, the automobile shop was no longer present on the Site and an additional dwelling was constructed. In the early 1940s, the northern portion of the Site was redeveloped into a sausage factory: the three dwellings and Ambassador Laundry were demolished. Between 1951 and 1967, the aluminum and bass foundry was replaced with parking spaces for the sausage factory. In 1992, a fire burned down the northwest portion of the sausage factory. It appears that shortly after the fire the sausage factory stopped operations, and the Site has remained vacant.           Numerous subsurface investigations have been conducted at the Site since the early 2000s which consist of the following:    2002 Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments - From November 2001 through January 2002, a Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) at the Site was conducted at the Site.  During the Phase I ESA reconnaissance, the Site consisted of a vacant industrial warehouse, the remaining concrete slab from the portion of the warehouse demolished during the 1992 fire, a concrete-paved truck dock area, an asphalt-paved parking area, and two USTs. Within the vacant industrial warehouse, multiple cold rooms, a compressor room, a loading room, a storage area, and an office were noted. Various debris and fire damage were observed inside the warehouse. During the Phase II ESA, an UST investigation was conducted as well as soil and groundwater sampling. Based on samples collected from within the USTs, the UST along Adeline Street probably contained fuel oil and the UST along Magnolia Street probably contained diesel, gasoline, or oil. During the subsurface investigation, four borings were advanced: B-1 through B-4. Soil results indicated lead was detected at B-2 at a concentration of 110 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg). In groundwater, fuel compounds including toluene and xylenes and chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) were observed. During the investigation, groundwater was encountered between 4.12 and 6.57 feet below ground surface (bgs).    2002 Soil and Groundwater Investigation - In June 2002, an additional subsurface investigation at the Site which included the advancement of  five soil borings (SB-1 through SB-5), from which three soil samples and three groundwater samples were collected. The soil and groundwater samples were analyzed for one or more of the following: total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) as diesel (TPH-d) and as gasoline (TPH-g); benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene; and xylene (BTEX); and methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE). Based on the results, no impacts to soil were observed above their respective residential screening levels. Groundwater, concentrations of TPH-g and TPH-d were detected above their environmental screening levels. During the investigation, groundwater was encountered between 4.5 to 8 feet bgs.     2003 Underground Tank Technical Closure Report - In November 2002, two underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed from the Site including a former 550-gallon gasoline UST (T-1) and former 350-gallon gasoline UST (T-2).  According to closure report, the USTs were installed in the early 1930s. In January 2003, two soil samples were collected from the T-1 excavation and one soil sample from the T-2 excavation. Additionally, groundwater from T-1 was also sampled. The soil and groundwater samples were analyzed for one or more of the following: TPH-d, TPH-g, BTEX, MTBE, and lead. Based on the results, no impacts to soil were observed above their residential shallow soil environmental screening level.  Groundwater concentrations of TPH-g, benzene, and lead were all detected above tier 1 environmental screening levels.    2006 Soil Groundwater, and Soil Vapor Investigation - in July 2006 eleven soil borings (GA-1 through GA-11) were advanced at the Site for soil and groundwater analysis and eight soil borings (SG-1 through SG-8) for soil vapor analysis. All soil, groundwater, and soil vapor samples were analyzed for TPH-d, TPH-g, BTEX, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Results indicated soil collected from soil boring GA-5 at 7.5 feet bgs reported decvtection of TPH-d  1,2000 mg\/kg. Out of the ten groundwater samples analyzed at the Site, samples (GA-2 and GA-9) exceeded the applicable environmental screening levels  for vinyl chloride (VC) (RWQCB, 2005). Additional analytes detected above regulatory environmental screening levels included TPH-g, benzene, trichloroethene (TCE), cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-1,2-DCE), and VC (RWQCB, 2019). During the investigation, groundwater was encountered between 6.1 to 26.5 feet bgs. All eight of the soil vapor samples exceed environmental screening levels for residential vapor intrusion risk for benzene, ethylbenzene, TCE, VC, and tetrachloroethene (PCE).     Additional subsurface investigations in all media are warranted to evaluate data gaps, possible remediation of discovered VOCs, engineering controls (e.g., vapor intrusion mitigation system) and institutional controls (e.g., land use covenant). Prior to occupancy, indoor air sampling for PCE, TCE, and benzene would likely be required to evaluate potential vapor intrusion risk and to comply with regulatory residential screening levels.",

A Dual Phase Extraction System operated at the site from 2014 to 2016, however secondary source remains at the site that requires additional corrective action. In April 2020, ACDEH requested collection of additional soil, groundwater and soil vapor data to inform the remedial approach and evaluate potential vapor intrusion risk to the adjacent residential neighborhood. The site is currently used as a hand car wash facility and therefore there is no immediate onsite vapor intrusion risk.",

Kleinfelder reported that the Southern Pacific Transportation  Company purchased the property in 1929 from Tilden Lumber and Mill  Company and retained ownership until 1987. The property was  leased to lumber wholesalers in the 1940's and 1950's for storage  and distribution of lumber arriving by rail. Kleinfelder reported  that aerial photographs taken in 1959 to 1975 indicate that the  southwestern half of the site and the adjacent lot to the north  (bordering Oak Street) apparently served as telephone pole storage  areas and possible treatment areas, although Kleinfelder reported  that none of the photos indicated the presence of drum storage or  staining or other visible signs of contamination.  After 1959, the site was used as a railroad team spur.  A team spur is a secondary location for freight handling for a number of companies which do not own private spurs. In 1980, the Ford Motor Company leased a portion of the property for freight storage. The property was purchased by Mr. George Vukasin in 1987.",

A review of the site shows that well S-11 contained concentrations of up to 1,210 ppb TPPH, and 39 ppb benzene in 1999 which may indicate that an uninvestigated onsite source is present adjacent to this well.  The 3 on-site wells were destroyed in 1999. The Phase I also indicated potential lead in paint and asbestos containing materials at the former building. Follow-up sampling conducted in 1999 indicated lead was not detected in paint and no asbestos containing materials were observed at the former building. The former building was demolished and the site is now occupied by a dialysis center.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site is a vacant warehouse build that formerly was occupied by a machine shop used for assembling glider aircraft.  Previous site use may have included a laundry and a plumbing contractor.  ACDEH-approved work plan for soil, groundwater, and soil vapor investigation has been implemented, Ph I ESA and SWI reports pending (anticipates submittal date of 5\/22\/2020- held pending payment).    Unauthorized released discovered during March 2-4, 2016 tank removal of a 1,000 gallon gasoline underground storage tank (UST).  Stained odiferous soil observed between 3.5 and 6 feet below the ground surface (bgs).  A maximum photoionization detector (PID) reading of 4,404 parts per million by volume (ppmv) at 4.5 feet bgs measured along the southwestern side of the tank pit.  Three excavation bottom soil samples collected as confirmation samples, at 8.5 feet at NW and SE ends of the UST and at 11.5 feet at the center of the UST.  Maximum concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline (TPHg), stoddard solvent (TPHss), TPH as diesel (TPHd), TPH as bunker oil (TPHbo), and TPH as heating oil (TPHho) were found in Sample B-11.5 at 610 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg), 620 mg\/kg, and 3,900 mg\/kg, for TPHg\/ss\/d respectively, and at 2,800 mg\/kg, 1,600mg\/kg, and 3,000 mg\/kg for TPHmo\/bo\/ho, respectively.  Groundwater was not encountered in the excavation.    On March 3, 2016, piping traced to a UST at edge of excavation lead to a second UST adjacent to and deeper than the 1,000-gallon UST.  On April 6-7, 2016 the second UST was removed.  Maximum PID reading of 3,967 ppmv was measured at 6.5 feet along the south side of the tank pit.  The second UST has a capacity of 1,400 gallons and appeared to be a fuel oil UST.  Stained soil was observed in the pit.  Two sidewall samples collected at a depth of 10 feet at NW and SE sidewalls of the UST pit.  Based on field observations, it was unclear if water at the base of the pit was tank rinseate or infiltration GW.   A sample of the tank contents was collected for analysis.  Maximum concentrations of TPH were reported for sample SW-10-SE at 150 mg\/kg TPHg and 280 mg\/kg TPHss.    No volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) were reported above laboratory reporting limits (LRL) though several LRLs exceeded their respective environmental screening level (ESLs) concentrations.      The pit GGW sample, B-10-W contained TPHg\/ss\/d concentrations of 8,000 micrograms per liter (ug\/L), 15,000 ug\/L, and 52,00 ug\/L, respectively, while TPHmo\/bo\/ho concentrations were at 13,000 ug\/L,  61,000 ug\/L,  and 49,000 ug\/L, respectively.  BEX [ ]  are 11 ug\/L, 13 ug\/L,  20 ug\/L, respectively.   The methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)  concentration was reported below the LRL, but had an elevated LRL and the naphthalene concentration was reported at 210 ug\/L.  Several other VOCs and metals Cr, Pb, Ni, and Cd were reported at concentrations  exceeding their respective ESLs.    During the course of the second tank removal, three potential tank filler ports were observed at the site.  As presented at the meeting, these ports did lead to USTs.  The two of the three USTs were  removed; August 1 &amp; 2, 2016.  The tank capacities were 300 gallons and 100 gallons.  A maximum PID reading of 2,454 ppmv was associated with the two USTs Green stained soil and hydrocarbon odors were observed in the tank pit.  The 300-gallon UST was observed to be in poor condition with holes. The 100-gallon UST appeared in good condition.   The tank pit was backfilled with the contaminated soil.   The fifth UST, having a capacity of 1,100 gallons, was removed on August 30 &amp; 31, 2016.  A maximum PID reading of 5,000 ppmv was associated with the UST.  The tank was reported to be in good condition. A total of 410 gallons of liquid was remove from the three tanks.    Approximately 200 feet of piping associated with the USTs were removed from approximately 40 feet of trench.  Green staining was observed around the majority of the piping, which contained residual fluid.      Commencing on August 31, 2016, three exploratory test pits were excavated to determine if other USTs may be present at the site.  No additional UST were identified.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is the former location of a retail petroleum fueling facility and currently the location of a strip mall. There are two other active leaking underground storage tank (LUST) cases located to the north and west of the Site, respectively. In 1958, a piping leak resulted in the release of an unknown volume of petroleum fuel of which approximately 650 gallons were reportedly recovered. In July 1971, three first-generation gasoline USTs, located in the southeastern portion of the Site, were removed and replaced. The second-generation USTs included a waste oil UST. A dispenser piping leak was documented in 1977. The second-generation USTs, except for the waste oil UST, were replaced in 1984 with third-generation USTs located to the north.  An unauthorized release was reported in February 1992 following the removal of the waste oil UST, located on the south side of the Site. Approximately 60 cubic yards of soil were excavated and disposed offsite. Soil sampling after the waste oil UST removal and soil excavation showed petroleum concentrations below laboratory detection limits. As a result, the waste oil UST was not a source of the unauthorized release, rather the release was from the generations of gasoline USTs, dispensers and piping leaks.  Mobile dual-phase extraction was intermittently conducted in 2001 which removed one pound of vapor-phase petroleum hydrocarbons and 18,588 gallons of impacted groundwater. The remaining third-generation gasoline USTs, located in the northern portion of the Site, were removed in 2002 as part of the fuel facility’s demolition. In February 2002, approximately 2,550 tons (1,250 cubic yards) of soil were removed and disposed offsite, approximately 16,000 gallons of impacted groundwater were extracted and disposed offsite, and 810 pounds of oxygen release compounds were placed at the bottom of the UST excavations. An additional 720 tons of impacted soil were excavated from a depth of approximately 20 feet below ground surface and disposed offsite in 2005. Active remediation has not been conducted at the Site for the past 14 years.  Since 1992, 14 groundwater monitoring wells have been installed, five were destroyed, and the remaining wells have been regularly monitored. According to groundwater data, water quality objectives (WQOs) have not been achieved.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Background:  The Site is 40 acres and is located at the Port Oakland adjacent to Oakland estuary. Union Pacific Railroad company operated a roundhouse at the Site between  1960's and 2006. They stored oil in an AST and waste oil, gasoline and diesel in USTs. These were used for operation of locomotives, automobiles and trucks.    Site Investigation and Remedial Activities:  Site investigations were conducted from 1991 through 2008 at the Former Union Pacific Roundhouse (Site).  One oil aboveground storage tank was removed before 1972.  Two diesel, one gasoline, one new oil, and one waste oil underground storage tanks were removed in 1991.    The Site is adequately characterized. Over the course of these investigations, nine monitoring wells were installed and monitored. The wells were properly destroyed in 2008.  In August 2008, additional shallow and deeper groundwater samples were collected at nine locations to evaluate the presence of dissolved petroleum constituents.     Under a Notice of Federal Interest (“NFI”) to address the product migration, the Site underwent United States Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”)-ordered remedial activities in 2004-2005. These remedial activities included the abandonment of the entire storm drain network and the installation of a new water-tight storm drain network consisting of shallow trench drains, sealed catch basins, fusion-welded high-density-polyethylene piping, and controlled-density-filled backfill barriers. The USEPA issued the Port of Oakland (“Port”) a Notice of Completion of the NFI-required response actions on November 8, 2005.      Soil Quality:  Soil analytical results indicate that separate-phase petroleum product (“SPH”) quantified in the diesel and motor oil hydrocarbon ranges is present in the subsurface at the Site.  Field observations have indicated that the SPH was laterally discontinuous and was distributed primarily near historical oil tanks and pipelines. Historical SPH migration appears to have been through preferential pathways (e.g., along storm drain lines).      Groundwater Quality:  In 2006 and 2007, the Port implemented a two-year Water Board-required product monitoring program to verify that the installed engineering controls had effectively addressed the preferential pathways such as the old storm drain lines.  The results of this additional investigation indicate that shallow and deeper groundwater zones are not in hydraulic continuity with each other and groundwater in both zones is not significantly impacted by dissolved-phase petroleum constituents from the SPH at the Site.  Additionally, all other sampled constituents including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are below the Water Board Environmental Screening Levels (“ESLs”) for commercial land use. Due to proximity of the Site to the San Francisco Bay, the shallow groundwater is saline and is not used as drinking water.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is within a vacant portion of the Foothill Square shopping center near the intersection of 108th Avenue and Foothill Boulevard in southeast Oakland, CA.  Areas adjacent to the site are used as a parking lot for the shopping center.  Surrounding land use is mixed commercial and residential.  The site was an automobile service station until July 1994 when the underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed and the service station demolished.    Petroleum hydrocarbons were first detected at the site during a subsurface investigation preformed as part of real estate transaction in February 1987.  During the February 1987 investigation, two groundwater monitoring wells (S-1 and S-2) were installed and four soil borings were advanced.      Four USTs (three 12,000-gallon gasoline and one 8,000-gallon diesel UST) were removed from the site on July 14, 1994.  Elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil samples collected from the tank excavation and dispenser islands.  Based on the results of confirmation sampling and visual evidence of contamination, the tank pit was overexcavated in August and September 1994.  A total of 775 cubic yards of soil was removed and disposed off-site during the overexcavation efforts.    Between February and November 1995, eight soil borings (B-1 through B-8) were advanced and six groundwater monitoring wells (MW-3 through MW-8) were installed.  Groundwater monitoring was initiated in 1995.    Dual-phase extraction (DPE) and air sparging (AS) were applied at the site intermittently between July 2004 and November 2007.  The objective of the intermittent events was to reduce the mass of petroleum hydrocarbons in the area of the former tanks.  The first three DPE events used well S-1, S-2, and MW-3 for extraction with MW-7 also used for extraction during the third DPE event.  Three subsequent DPE events were completed using wells EX-1 through EX-4 for extraction.  In an attempt to improve removal efficiency, two air sparging wells (AS-1 and AS-2) were installed in 2007.  A DPE\/AS event was conducted between September 4 and November 14, 2007.  An estimated 698.8 pounds of petroleum hydrocarbons were removed in the vapor phase during the seventh DPE\/AS event.  The overall mass of petroleum hydrocarbons removed during the seven DPE and DPE\/AS events was estimated at 797.3 pounds.     An iSOC™ oxygen injection system operated at the site between January 22, 2006 and September 4, 2007.  Individual injection units that produce dissolved oxygen were placed in wells S-1, S-2, and MW-3 from January 11, 2006 to December 18, 2006.  In December 2006, the iSOC™ injection units were moved from wells S-1 and MW-3 to wells EX-1 and EX-2.  The operation of the oxygen injection system was discontinued on September 4, 2007, prior to initiation of a DPE\/AS event.    To assess the potential for vapor intrusion to indoor air, a soil vapor sampling survey was conducted in October 2009.  A total of 39 soil gas sampling points were advanced and sampled at depths of 4 and 9 feet bgs (SV-1A\/b through SV-20A\/B).  The concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons detected in the soil vapor samples exceeded screening levels for commercial land use at numerous sampling locations.  A Corrective Action Plan prepared in February 2010 and a Revised Corrective Action Plan prepared in May 2010 selected excavation as the preferred remedial alternative.    Soil excavation of the former UST and dispenser areas was conducted between July 26, 2010 and August 25, 2010.  A total of approximately 7,829 tons of soil and 2,566 pounds of gasoline range petroleum hydrocarbons was removed during the excavation.  A total of 45 sidewall and 22 base confirmation samples were collected to guide overexcavation where necessary.  The excavated soils were disposed off-site and the excavation was backfilled with backfill material from Vulcan Quarry in Pleasanton, CA.  Prior to backfilling, approximately 63 tons of gypsum was spread at the base of the excavation to enhance anaerobic degradation of residual petroleum hydrocarbons.    Following completion of the excavation, 39 soil vapor samples were collected in October 2010 to confirm the effectiveness of the excavation in reducing the concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil vapor.  Based on the results of the October 2010 soil vapor survey, the concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil vapor are below Environmental Screening Levels (San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board May 2008) for potential vapor intrusion to indoor air.",

On June 22, 1999, Aqua Science Engineers, Inc. installed a boring in which contamination was verified.  In July 1999, additional borings were installed at the site, followed by monitoring well installations (MW-1 through MW-3) in August 1999.  In October 1999, a fourth monitoring well was installed.  In November 1999, approximately 24 cubic yards of impacted soil was excavated from the site.   Ten additional borings were installed in August 2002 to delineate the vertical and lateral extent of contamination.  In March 2006, four additional borings were installed at the site to further investigate that lateral and vertical extent of contamination present near previously installed boring BH-O.

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at https:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Site is currently occupied by a car wash.  A retail gasoline service station was reported to have operated on the property from at least 1954 until about 1976.  Chevron has been contractually obligated to provide investigation and cleanup at the subject site.  This case was opened in 2016 following an inquiry to ACDEH from a property owner representative regarding the status of investigation and cleanup activities.        Following the station closure, the underground storage tanks (USTs) and appurtenant piping and dispensers were reportedly removed.  In January 2006, four soil bores, SB1 thru SB4, were advanced to a depth of 15- to 21 feet bgs for the recovery of soil and GGW samples.    Laboratory analysis of soil samples were reported to include up to 320 mg\/kg TPHg, 1.6 mg\/kg benzene, and 3.6 mg\/kg ethyl benzene.   Laboratory analysis of GGW samples were reported to include up to 7,400 ug\/L TPHg, 370 ug\/L benzene, and 250 ug\/L ethyl benzene with MTBE and naphthalene reported to 14 ug\/L and 230 ug\/L, respectively.   A heavy hydrocarbon LNAPL was observed in one soil bore (SB-4).  The results of the investigation indicated an unauthorized release occurred at the site, resulting in opening this fuel leak case.    Previous environmental investigations included the installation of six (6) groundwater monitoring wells in March 2006 for the Chevron Environmental Management Company.     Since 2017 the six on-site wells have undergone quarterly monitoring after a nine year hiatus. The maximum concentrations reported in groundwater since monitoring resumed in 2017 are 520 and 150 micrograms per liter (ug\/L) for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline (TPHg) and TPH as diesel (TPHd), respectively, 9.4 ug\/L benzene and 1.0 ug\/L ethyl benzene.  The maximum concentration of MTBE reported since groundwater monitoring resumed in 2017 is 0.8 ug\/L. Analysis of water from the most recent event (January 15, 2019) indicates well MW-2 has the highest TPHg concentration (520 ug\/L).  As there are no down gradient wells to support plume definition in the direction from the tank pit beyond MW-2, the plume is undefined.  ACDEH observes that since the resumption of groundwater monitoring in 2017 well MW-2 is demonstrating increasing concentration trends for TPHg and TPHd.       Groundwater at the site ranges from 1.88 feet bgs (MW-4 on 4\/18\/2018) to 8.61 feet (MW-4 on 10\/31\/2017).    In 2019 a sensitive receptor survey was conducted.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    On June 16, 1987, three gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed from the Site and a suspect unauthorized release was confirmed.  Two USTs had a capacity of 1,000 gallons and one UST held 550 gallons of gasoline. Soil was reportedly excavated to 9 feet bgs, aerated onsite for one month to acceptable levels (no confirmation samples were analyzed), and used as fill material to backfill the UST excavation.  Groundwater monitoring wells MW-1 through MW-3 were installed in June 1987 and well MW-1 initially contained 30 inches of free phase floating product.  Free product also detected in monitoring well at off-site down-gradient property.  Free phase has not been seen recently in site or vicinity wells; however, groundwater concentrations in onsite well MW-1 and off-site well MW-5 are substantially above concentrations that the LTCP Soil Vapor Technical Justification paper states is indirect evidence of free phase.  At a minimum substantial residual soil contamination appears to reside at or below the depth of the UST excavation to groundwater, generally encountered at a depth of approximately 22 to 23 feet below surface grade.  The historic groundwater contaminant plume extends northward; however, groundwater currently appears to flow westward, and additional investigation into this aspect is required.  The potential for soil vapor intrusion to on- and offsite properties has been undertaken with the installation of four offsite groundwater monitoring wells (MW-7 to MW-10), the installation of 24 soil vapor wells (SV-1 to SV-24) of varying depth, installation of eight sub-slab vapor points (SS-1 to SS-8), and the collection of indoor air at multiple locations and times.  A Soil Vapor Extraction (SVE) pilot test has been conducted utilizing this groundwater and vapor well network, and appears to be a viable corrective action option.  Air Sparging (AS), including offsite horizontal AS wells, has been proposed as the corrective action option, but has not been fully tested.    A CAP was submitted in July 2019, comments on the CAP by the adjacent property owner in August 2019, and a meeting was requested in September 2019 to identify a path forward.

Commercial and industrial operations comprise neighboring properties to the northwest, south, and southeast. A residential neighborhood lies across San Leandro Creek and north of the Site. As a result of a 2020 investigation related to former leaking underground storage tanks (UST) on the Site, a soil sample collected near the former gasoline UST was reported to contain chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) of trichloroethene (TCE), cis-1,2-dichloroethene (DCE), and vinyl chloride above risk based screening levels. Subsequently, 14 grab ground water samples were collected from 14 locations to assess conditions related to the former USTs and general Site operations. Nine ground water samples contained measurable concentrations of CVOCs, with the groundwater sample nearest the former gasoline UST yielding the highest concentration of TCE at 210 micrograms per liter (μg\/l).",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "CURRENT CASE STATUS:  Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO003369 was opened by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) in 2019 after executing a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement (VRAA) with Dalzell Corporation dated August 20, 2019 to provide regulatory oversight for the investigation and cleanup of the site to facilitate redevelopment with residential housing. On April 17, 2020 ACDEH issued a directive letter conditionally approving implementation of proposed corrective actions and site redevelopment as presented in the Corrective Action Plan (CAP) and Corrective Action Implementation Plan (CAIP) for the Site.    On April 2, 2021, the property (consisting of three parcels identified by Alameda County Assessor Parcel Number’s (APNs) 5-435-18-1, 5-436-17, and 5-436-5) was sold to Riaz Capital. Upon execution of a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement with Riaz Capital on March 3, 2022, the VRAA with Dalzell was terminated and Riaz assumed responsibility for implementation of the CAP and CAIP and obtaining the necessary approvals from the City of Oakland Planning and Building Department for the proposed Site redevelopment project presented in Preliminary Redevelopment Plans and implement the corrective actions presented in the CAIP during Site redevelopment activities. The proposed redevelopment consists of twelve slab-on-grade 3-story residential units with shared open space with no anticipated sub-grade parking, parking lifts, or elevators.    SITE  HISTORY:  The Site is located in a mixed-use industrial\/commercial and residential area of the McClymonds neighborhood of Oakland. The subject site consists of three adjacent rectangular parcels totaling approximately 0.57-acres and is currently developed as a vacant “L-shaped” industrial building with loft, one-story industrial shed with canopy, and associated paved areas; the southwestern parcel, APN 5-435-5, is developed as a residential dwelling and associated paved area; and the eastern parcel APN 5-435-17 is undeveloped. The residential dwelling is currently occupied by private residences (2420 Helen Street). Adjacent properties include several residential dwellings and commercial businesses.    The onsite industrial structure with loft is located along the northwestern portion of the site with the main entrance located along the west side of the building providing access to the office area. An additional personnel door and roll-up door are located along the west side of the building as well as two roll-up doors and additional personnel doors located on the east side of the building. The building is segregated into an office area, warehouse area, auto maintenance area, and two separate lofts.     The office area is located on the south and west sides of the building and consists of an open offices area, lobby, conference room, and restroom facilities. The warehouse area is located centrally and occupies the majority of the structure. The warehouse area consists of a large open warehouse with two lofts on the north and south portions of the area respectively and several segregated rooms under each loft (presumably former office or storage rooms).The auto maintenance area is located along the northeast side of the building and did not reveal any obvious evidence drains, sumps or other conduits to the subsurface.  The north loft area is located on the north wall of the building above the warehouse area. Access to the loft is via a staircase located on the center portion of the north wall and consists of two rooms. The south loft area is located on the south wall of the warehouse area above the warehouse area. Access to the loft is via a staircase located on the south portion of the warehouse area and utilized for miscellaneous storage.      The large industrial shed with loft is located along the northeastern portion of the subject site (See Photos 15-16). The main entrance is a sliding door located along the south side of the building providing access to the office area. An additional sliding door is located along the west side of the building as well. The building consists of a large open area.    The one-story residential dwelling is located at the western portion of the southern parcel and is raised off the ground on a pier foundation. The main entrance to the building is located on the west side of the building and accessible by a staircase. An additional door is located along the east side of the building.    Historical operations on all three parcels included various residential configurations and numerous commercial operations including a cabinet shop, plaster storage, irrigation supply company, lighting business, elevator company, CPA, and general contractor facility. During the Phase I evidence of a potential underground storage tank was observed and included the observation of a potential vent pipe and fill port, respectively.  Additionally, based on site interviews, an unknown-size underground storage tank (UST) was noted to be removed from the Site around 1980, however, no agency removal documentation was available for review.  Lastly based on information presented in the Phase I, documentation was observed from October 2017 that notes the presence of approximately twenty \"chemical tanks\" on the property.    In January 2019, during a pre-sale property transaction, subsurface investigations were conducted without regulatory oversight including the advancement of eight borings (B1 through B8) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey. Static groundwater was encountered between approximately 7.2 feet to 16.7 feet below ground surface (bgs).  Soil results indicated gasoline range total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH-g) ethylbenzene, naphthalene, and phenol were detected above 2019 January San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board's Tier 1 environmental screening levels (ESLs).  Metals were also reported above Tier 1 ESLs including barium, cobalt, nickel, and vanadium. Groundwater results indicated petroleum-related and non-petroleum-related constituents of concern (COCs) were reported above ESLs including TPH-g, diesel range total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH-d), benzene, tetrachloroethene (PCE), and trichloroethene (TCE). GPR results indicated buried piping in piping trenches and five buried anomalies in the concrete-covered portion of the property.  Additionally, two anamolies consistent with former fuel dispenser pads with two former bollards were observed in front of former fuel dispenser pads at the ends of the piping trenches.  The former fuel dispenser pads were observed to have been removed and the concrete patched, and the bollards had been cut off flush with the top of the concrete pads that were located adjacent to the former fuel dispenser pads.    Additional subsurface investigations without regulatory oversight we reconducted in April 2019 and included the advancement of three soil borings (B9 through B11) and six sub-slab soil gas Vapor Pins (VP-1 through VP-6) in the vacant warehouse floor, and exploratory excavation of former UST pits, associated UST piping, and dispenser pads identified in the previous GPR.  Soil and groundwater results indicated chlorinated solvents including TCE was reported above ESLs in groundwater.  Soil vapor results indicated PCE and TCE concentrations were detected in all vapor pin sample above Tier 1 ESLs.  Exploratory excavation reported no detectable discoloration, odors, or PID values identified at any of the locations investigated with the exception of location T5, where strong petroleum hydrocarbon odor, discolored soil with bluish-gray staining, and PID readings of 115 to 194 ppm were encountered at location between the depths of 10 and 13 feet bgs.      A Data Gap Investigation Workplan (the Work Plan) for additional subsurface investigations was included as Section 4 and Attachment B of the Corrective Action Plan (CAP), dated August 5, 2019. Approval of the Work Plan was granted by ACDEH on September 3, 2019. The scopeof work began in September 2019 and included additional on- and potential off-site step out investigations to address the data gaps including but not limited to lateral and vertical characterization of soil vapor beneath the property; collection of soil data in the vicinity of observation boring T5; completion of an underground utility survey to verify locations of potential soil vapor conduits beneath the property; characterization of shallow soil across the property to evaluate potential exposure to future construction workers and adjacent properties during site grading\/soil disturbance as part of the property redevelopment; and additional groundwater characterization with three on-Site groundwater monitoring wells to confirm results of previous grab groundwater sampling and determining Site-specific groundwater flow direction.  The scope of work included the advancement of 25 shallow borings in a grid across the entire Site.  The Site is separated into five sample grid areas (Grid Area #1 through Grid Area #5).  One 5-point composite sample and one discrete soil was collected from each Grid Area at a depth of approximately 0.5 feet bgs.  Three onsite groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-3) were advanced to a depth of approximately 20 feet bgs.  Eight soil vapor points (SVP-1 through SVP-5 and SVP-9 though SVP-11) and three dual nested soil vapor points (SVP-6 through SVP 8) were advanced to a depth of five feet bgs and three dual nested soil vapor points at depths of five and nine feet bgs.  Results of these on- and off-site investigations are presented in the Data Gap Investigation Report and Addendum to Corrective Action Plan (the “Addendum”), dated March 26, 2020.    The proposed corrective actions presented in the August 2019 CAP include but are not limited to remedial excavation of petroleum and non-petroleum related COCs as determined by the results of the Work Plan indicated above and detailed in the Addendum.  Additional corrective actions include the installation of Vapor Mitigation Engineering Controls (VMEC) including a vapor mitigation system beneath the proposed new building footprint located on all three parcels to control potential vapor migration to indoor air, and installation of trench dams and\/or plugs along utility corridors to control vapor migration along preferential pathways.      Concurrent with the September 2019 subsurface investigations, ACDEH initiated the public participation process for the Site through the distribution of a Fact Sheet to the surrounding community on September 18, 2019 and invitation for public comment regarding the corrective actions proposed in the CAP.  No comments were received by ACDEH or RMD during the 30-day public comment period. ACDEH requires additional community involvement to be conducted by the Responsible Party (RP) throughout the environmental cleanup and redevelopment of the Site to inform the surrounding community of proposed corrective actions presented in the CAP and CAIP and upcoming work at the Site.    First encountered groundwater beneath and in the vicinity of the Site has been observed at depths ranging from approximately 7.5 feet below ground surface (bgs) to 22.5 feet bgs in boring logs and groundwater monitoring wells installed during site characterization activities conducted at the Site and at nearby cleanup cases including two cases associated with the Vincent Academy Charter Elementary School located at 2499 and 2501 Chestnut Street approximately 70 feet west of the Site [closed SCP Case No. 01S0653 - Vincent Academy (formerly Liden Lofts) and open Envirostor Case ID 60002958 – Vincent Academy Charter Elementary School], and two cases associated with the McClymonds High School located at 2607 Myrtle Street approximately 650 feet northeast of the Site (Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Cleanup Case No. RO0000292 – City of Oakland McClymond High School and Envirostor Case ID 60002956 – McClymonds High School].",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is located in a mixed commercial and residential area of the Hoover-Foster neighborhood in Oakland at the southeastern corner of the intersection between San Pablo Avenue and 33rd Street.  The property is currently vacant and consists of one accessor parcel number 9-722-7 which covers approximately 11,500-square feet (SF).  A 2,841-SF, single-story building occupied the eastern quarter of the site until it was demolished in July 2019.  The single-story building consists of pier foundation and wood flooring with three office areas, two bathrooms, and a kitchen area.The remaining quarters of the property are paved with asphalt.     The Site is bound to the north by 33rd Street and further by People’s Car Wash and Auto Detail (3314 San Pablo Avenue); to the east by multi-family residential properties; to the south by a senior housing development operated by St. Andrew’s Manor (3250 San Pablo Avenue); and to the west by San Pablo Avenue and further mixed commercial and residential properties.      Historical operations at the Site included a mattress and upholstering business; a building contractor and structural engineer with associated storage yard operations; including warehouse and office uses; a termite control business; a Baptist church; and most recently an office and classroom for an educational center and a civil rights organization. Records indicate the property has been vacant since October 2017.    Redevelopment plans include construction of a five-story senior housing facility that will cover nearly the entire footprint of the Site. The building will accommodate 51 units of affordable senior housing, and include parking, office, laundry spaces, outdoor gardening, communal areas, landscaping, bicycle parking, and other amenities    Two Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs) were conducted by Essel Environmental Engineering and Consulting (Essel) in 2015 and 2019 on behalf of Satellite Affordable Housing Associates (SAHA). The 2015 Phase I ESA was conducted as part of SAHA’s due diligence effort toward developing the property with a residential apartment building. The second 2019 Phase I ESA was to update the 2015 assessment as which time only the main eastern building was present on the property and this building was vacant. Conclusions of both Phase I ESAs indicated that no recognized environmental conditions (RECs) were present at the Site in connection with historic and\/or current Site uses.  However, the Phase I ESAs identified petroleum hydrocarbon impact to soil and ground water at nearby properties. Additional conclusions in the ESAs recommended further evaluation and investigation to assess potential vapor encroachment conditions (VECs) at the Site prior to proposed redevelopment.    Subsequent to the 2019 ESA, a Phase II subsurface soil and soil vapor investigations were conducted in April\/May 2019 without regulatory oversight.  The investigation included the advancement of five bores (B1 through B5) for soil sampling to a total depth of five feet to six feet below ground surface (bgs) and the advancement of three bores (SV1 through SV3) for the installation of soil vapor probes to a total depth of seven feet to eight feet bgs.   Results of the soil samples indicated TPH-mo was detected in all five samples up to 3,100 (milligrams per kilogram; mg\/kg) at a depth of 0.5 feet bgs.  Detections of SVOCs, pesticides, and metals above the January 2019 San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board's environmental screening levels (ESLs) for residential human health risk levels was also reported in shallow soil (0-1 foot interval) at the Site.  Additionally, soil vapor sample reported detections of TPH-g and the chlorinated solvents including tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene above ESLs.  This data indicate that an unauthorized release has occurred at the Site and further investigation is warranted.    On July 16, 2019, 3268 San Pablo, L.P. (the responsible party; RP)entered into a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement (VRAA) with Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH), with concurrence from the California Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC), to provide regulatory oversight for the redevelopment project under Site Cleanup Program (SCP) Case No. RO00003377.      On July 21, 2019, an initial meeting was conducted with the RP, their environmental consultants Essel Environmental Engineering and Consulting (Essel) and Langan, and ACDEH to discuss subsurface impacts from historic land use at the subject site (the Site), the redevelopment project and schedule, and a proposed vapor mitigation system as presented in Langan’s Basis of Design for Vapor Mitigation System (the BOD), dated July 19, 2019.  During the meeting, ACDEH was informed that a building permit had been issued by the City of Oakland Building Department and that Site demolition activities had already started.  Based on ACDEH’s review of the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, dated April 8, 2019, prepared by Essel and the Report Soil Characterization and Limited Soil Vapor Survey dated May 27, 2018, prepared by Essel, an unauthorized release of chemicals of concern (COCs) to the subsurface from historic land uses has occurred ACDEH directed the RP  to cease demolition of hard scape and foundation activities until the Site has been adequately characterized, corrective actions identified and approved by ACDEH, and adequate controls and mitigation measures put in place to protect the surrounding community during Site redevelopment.  Prior to restarting Site demolition activities, ACDEH is requiring the RP to submit a Construction Soil and Groundwater Management Plan (SGMP), distribute a Fact Sheet and hold a community meeting to discuss the potential contaminants of concern (COCs) detected in the subsurface; conduct additional subsurface investigation activities; submit a corrective action plan, and implement approved corrective action and control measures to protect the surrounding community during Site redevelopment activities.    On July 29, 2019 ACDEH conditionally approved documents entitled Work Plan Soil and Groundwater Investigation and Soil Vapor Survey (the Work Plan), dated July 24, 2019 and Construction Soil and Groundwater Management Plan (the SGMP) dated July 26, 2019.  The scope of work for the Work Plan includes the advancement of five bores for the collection of soil and groundwater (B6 through B10), one sub-slab vapor pin (SV6), and five soil gas probes (SV4, SV5, SV7 through SV9).  The proposed locations of the soil and groundwater samples were chosen based on an assumed southwest groundwater gradient direction obtained from adjacent environmental cases to assess offsite migration and further onsite delineation.  The sub-slab vapor pin location is proposed beneath of the existing building foundation (prior to demolition) and the five proposed soil vapor probes were chosen based on detections of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) in previous soil vapor samples collected from the center of the Site and site boundaries.  Results of this investigation are pending.    On August 1, 2019, ACDEH conducted a presentation a during a community meeting with the Hoover-Foster Resident Action Committee.  The objective of the presentation was to discuss current site conditions, community protection measures, next steps for the Site including a corrective action plan prior to demolition of existing hardscape and remaining foundations, future activities, and available contact information.",

A program of groundwater monitoring was implemented in 1991 and dissolved phase contamination is migrating offsite and impacting the downgradient sites located at 726 and 706 Harrison Street.  Soil and groundwater sampling completed in 2007 detected elevated levels of MTBE in the deeper water bearing zone at 48 feet bgs. This site is part of a commingled plume and remedial action is proposed to remove residual mass beneath the sites.  A pilot test of multi-phase extraction and air sparging\/soil vapor extraction was conducted in 2013.    Based on the results of the pilot test, remediation of 706 and 726 Harrison Street is planned to begin in 2014 using air sparging and soil vapor extraction.  A Remedial Action Plan that describes the planned remediation was approved in July 2014 following a public comment period on the Remedial Action Plan.",

Case opening was triggered due to a provision recorded in Alameda County Environmental Health’s August 14, 1998 closure of former Fuel Leak Case No. RO0000966, Lloyd Wise Honda Nissan site, located at 10500 International Boulevard, Oakland (APN 47-5509-41) requiring evaluation of residual contamination left in place if the site was redeveloped. This site previously contained a 2,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tank (UST) and a 550 gallon waste-oil UST which were removed in February 1993.      Documents in the RO0002964 case file contain information collected during (1) investigation and cleanup of the former Fuel Leak Case No. RO000096, Lloyd Wise Honda Nissan (APN-47-5509-41), and (2) during a voluntary cleanup agreement with the Oakland Unified School District and the  Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Toxic Substances Control in 2001 in conjunction with a formerly proposed redevelopment project of a larger area in the vicinity of the site (including the 10 parcels owned by Bartarse) as a school property.     Plans for the proposed 2007 residential redevelopment project were withdrawn and since no additional investigation activities were conducted in association with the proposed project, the case was closed with the same provision recorded in Alameda County Environmental Health’s August 14, 1998 closure of former Fuel Leak Case No. RO0000966, Lloyd Wise Honda Nissan site, located at 10500 International Boulevard, Oakland (APN 47-5509-41) requiring evaluation of residual contamination left in place if the site was redeveloped.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "A gasoline service station operated at the site until 1980. Free product was reported in a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) tunnel under the intersection of 7th Street and Broadway in January 1979.  Approximately 2,600 gallons of a gasoline and water mixture was removed from the BART tunnel between October 1979 and April 1980.  Groundwater monitoring and extraction wells were installed at the site between 1981 and 1988.  On-site and off-site investigations were conducted at the site between 1994 and 2006.  A Corrective Action Plan was prepared for the site in February 2008.  Remediation by excavation and  secondary remediation by in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) was approved as an interim remedial action in April 2008. Onsite soil excavation to 20 feet bgs was conducted in June 2008. ISCO injections were conducted at the site between December 2008 and August 2009.    The site was redeveloped in 2017. A five-story building with a subterranean garage and commercial spaces on the ground floor and residential units on the upper floors was constructed. Construction included excavation to 14 feet bgs in the vicinity of the subterranean parking areas. During excavation, impacted soil was encountered near the base of the excavation at 14 feet bgs. Fill soil was emplaced on top of the contaminated soil. No soil samples were collected so the petroleum compound concentrations left in soil are unknown.     Semi-annual groundwater monitoring is being performed. During the First Quarter 2019, free product was observed in onsite monitoring well S-25 and in offsite monitoring well S-5. On behalf of Shell, AECOM reported up to 840 ug\/L benzene and 64 ug\/L ethylbenzene in groundwater samples recently collected from the site (well S-6, 27 March 2018).     ACDEH requested a corrective action plan (CAP) to address free product beneath and downgradient of the site and an updated evaluation of vapor intrusion risk that incorporates current site construction and recent site data. ACDEH also required delineation of offsite groundwater impacts.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is currently an active ARCO fueling station with a station building, two dispenser islands, and three 12,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs). Surrounding land use is primarily single- and multi-family residences with commercial buildings located east and southeast of the property. In June 1988, during removal of four gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs), a release of petroleum hydrocarbons was identified from a former UST at the west side of the station building. The release has resulted in a shallow groundwater petroleum plume. Since the release was identified, cleanup has included groundwater extraction and treatment (1993 to 1995) and placement of oxygen release compound into groundwater to enhance biodegradation (1995 to 2000). Concentrations of gasoline and benzene in groundwater have remained elevated, averaging approximately 5,000 and 1,000 micrograms per liter respectively, since 2001. Due to the remaining presence of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health has requested that the responsible party initiate cleanup activities to remove petroleum contamination and thus reduce risk to downgradient residential receptors from potential vapor intrusion or incidental exposure to shallow contaminated groundwater that may intrude into basements, sumps, French drains, etc. A dual phase extraction (DPE) pilot test in the area of the historic release demonstrated that dual phase extraction is an effective remedial technology. ACDEH has met with the community and received feedback. Based on the demonstrated effectiveness of the pilot test, ACDEH requested a feasibility study and updated SCM to include the use of DPE as an evaluated remedial option utilizing an alternative power source (electrical connection) to avoid diesel fumes and noise generation.",

As of December 2018, the northern-most warehouse is used for storage, while the southern warehouse is used as an indoor fitness facility. The site is surrounded primarily by single-and multi-family residential housing.     A 3,750-gallon UST was removed from the site in February 2000. Soil samples collected during the removal detected up to 920 mg\/kg TPHg, 0.30 mg\/kg benzene, and 850 mg\/kg TPHd and groundwater samples detected up to 34,000 micrograms per liter (ug\/L) TPHg, 3,300 ug\/L benzene, and 7,400 ug\/L TPHd, which indicated an unauthorized release of petroleum hydrocarbons had occurred and this Leaking Underground Fuel Tank (LUFT) case was opened to investigate the release.    Environmental investigations have been ongoing since 2000 and have included installation of a groundwater monitoring well network and collection of soil, groundwater and soil gas samples. Interim remedial excavation was conducted in 2009 inside the warehouse and immediately down-gradient of the former UST location; 1,100 tons of contaminated soil to a depth of 12 feet bgs was removed from an excavation measuring 35 feet by 75 feet.  Between December 2021 and February 2022, a dual phase extraction was pilot tested on four on-Site monitoring wells which resulted in the removal of less than 40 pounds of petroleum hydrocarbons. Subsequent to the pilot test, Alameda County requested an updated evaluation of remedial alternatives for the Site, including the results of the dual phase pilot test.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Three underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed from the Eandi Metal Works facility on May 11, 1992.  Two of the USTs were located at the main portion of the Eandi Metal Works facility at 976 23rd Avenue and a 1,000-gallon gasoline UST was removed from the sidewalk area adjacent to the Eandi Metal Works building at 1440 East Eleventh Street.  Soil samples collected adjacent to the two USTs removed from 976 23rd Avenue did not contain petroleum hydrocarbons at concentrations above reporting limits or contained low concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons that were below applicable screening levels.  Soil samples collected from the area of the 1,000-gallon UST at 1440 East Eleventh Street contained elevated concentrations of the TPHg and BTEX.  Site investigation activities for this case have been focused on the former UST location at 1440 East Eleventh Street.  Surrounding land use to 1440 East Eleventh Street is mixed commercial and residential.      Following the removal of the 1,000-gallon gasoline UST from the sidewalk area adjacent to 1440 East Eleventh Street in May 1992, the soil from the tank pit excavation was spread nearby and allowed to aerate for nine months.  The soil was then placed back in the excavation and covered with steel trench plates.  In June 2004, the tank pit was partially re-excavated to collect soil samples from the sidewalls and base of the former tank pit.  Petroleum hydrocarbons and oxygenates were not detected at concentrations above reporting limits.  The tank pit was completely re-excavated in September 2004.  The removed soil was air dried and then replaced in the excavation using a compactor.  The UST area was then repaved in September 2004.    In July 1995, five soil borings were advanced in the area of the former UST.  Three of the borings were converted into monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-3) and the remaining two borings (E-1 and E-2) were advanced to collect soil samples within the tank pit.  Groundwater monitoring was conducted periodically from July 1995 to September 2010.    In August 2004, seven soil borings (B-1 through B-7) were advanced to depths of 20 to 32 feet bgs to collect soil and grab groundwater samples.  The grab groundwater results indicated that a plume of dissolved petroleum hydrocarbons extended approximately 200 feet downgradient (southwest) from the tank pit area.      On September 28, 2006, two soil borings were advanced to a depth of 17 feet bgs for soil sampling and then were converted to monitoring wells (MW-4 and MW-5).      On September 8, 2011, soil gas samples were collected from three locations.  Total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline were detected in each of the three soil gas samples at concentrations ranging from 20 to 55 ppb.  Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes were not detected at concentrations exceeding reporting limits.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Meeting held September 11, 2019 to discuss the results of the most recent analytical data for the site and that collected at the adjoining property located a 309 63rd Street and the path to closure.  Three hot spots remain for the RHK site- one of which can be addressed with the existing sub-slab depressurization system.  Methods need to be evaluated to address the remaining two areas.  Additionally, contamination to the south of the RHK property has not been investigated.  Adjacent properties need to be evaluated for health risks and mitigative measures taken, if warranted.      Meeting held May 28, 2019 to discuss case status and path forward.  Discussion included neighboring 309 63rd Street  property data.  Path forward to include indoor air and VP &amp; SG sampling at Mehta and sampling event of RHK's VPs, SGs and MWs.  Data to be discussed at next meeting.      Note that the address for the building occupied by Red Hanger Kleaners was originally referenced by the addresses of 6335-6339 College Avenue and documents prepared prior to 2015 referenced this address.  Some time during the latter third of 2015 the addressing of the site was changing to use the correct address of 6235-6239 College Avenue.    In 2005 a Phase I investigation performed for in support of a property transfer identified Recognized Environmental Conditions associated with a former gasoline underground storage tank (UST) and historical dry cleaning activities that have been conducted since 1987.    In May 2005, a subsequent Phase II investigation was performed to assess contamination from these activities.  Borings SB-1 through SP-5 were advanced during this investigation.  In the area of the UST, a geophysical survey was first conducted to determine if the UST was still in place.  It was determined that it had been removed.  One soil boring was advanced in this area.  No TPHg, TPHd, or BTEX were detected in soil in this area.  Groundwater was not sampled in this area.  Borings were advanced in the dry cleaning machine area.  The maximum concentration in soil was 0.26 ppm PCE.  Groundwater was sampled at one location with a maximum concentration of 48 ppb PCE and 0.83 ppb chloroform.  No other VOC was detected in groundwater.    In June 2005 The City of Oakland, Fire Department requested that an additional groundwater sample be collected.  PCE was detected at 15 ppb and chloroform at 0.83 ppb.    In May 2008, P&amp;D Environmental collected soil and groundwater samples at locations B-7 and B-8 which were generally upgradient of the site. PCE was detected in soil in boring B-7 at 3 feet bgs at a concentration of 0.0078 ppm.   PCE was detected in groundwater at a maximum concentration of 12 ppb from B-7.  No results or boring log were shown for boring B-9 although it is on the P&amp;D’s map.  In October and December 2009, ERM performed soil and groundwater sampling from downgradient of the dry cleaning machines and near the UST area.  PCE was detected at a maximum concentration of 0.010 ppm from 6.5 feet bgs from soil borings collected in the building interior.  Soil samples collected from 25 and 30 feet bgs were below the detection limit.  Groundwater was collected from outside the building at a maximum concentration of 1.9 ppb PCE.      A soil vapor survey and screening level risk assessment was performed by EFI Global in January 2013.  Four soil gas samples (and one duplicate) were collected in December 2012.  PCE was reported in all four samples with concentration ranging from 200 ug\/m3 to 11,000 ug\/m3.  Based on the findings of the assessment, EFI recommended case closure. At the request of ACEH, Youngdahl conducted a soil and soil gas and in-door air investigation in the first half of 2015.  The investigation consisted of recovering 11 soil gas samples collected at the depth of 5 feet bgs, 3 sub-slab soil gas samples collected from beneath the building slab, and 7 air sample (5 indoor air and 2 background).   All soil gas samples were reported to contain concentration of PCE, ranging from 250 ug\/m3 to 17,000 ug\/m3 for the 5-foot soil gas samples and 610 ug\/m3 to 5,200 ug\/m3 for the sub-slab samples.  The 5 indoor air samples were reported to contain assortment of VOCs including PCE concentrations ranging from 3.3 ug\/m3 to 41 ug\/m3 and chloroform ranging from 0.32 ug\/m3 to 33 ug\/m3.  Three of the indoor air samples contained TCE at concentrations ranging from 5.1 ug\/m3 to 88 ug\/m3, two of which exceeded the  urgent response action level (URAL).  The conclusions provided in the report stated that PCE concentrations were below the USEPA RSL for commercial use.  And that,as no TCE was found in the soil gas  samples, the source of the TCE is not due to vapor intrusion, however, the TCE concentrations exceed the USEPA response action benchmarks for vapor intrusion (upper floors only).      It was noted the dry cleaner had vacated the premises and the suite was vacant.    On November 3, 2015, P&amp;D Environmental published an indoor air and mitigation report for follow up on the source and confirmation of TCE exceedances reported by Youngdahl.   As part of the study, the analytical laboratory reviewed it's data and determined it's TCE concentrations were inflated by one order of magnitude.  The lower TCE concentrations then became below the URAL but still exceeded the accelerated response action level (ARAL).  P&amp;D Environmental collected episodes of indoor air sampling following assorted mitigation measures.  Currently the indoor air TCE concentrations are below the commercial indoor air ESL.    An investigation consisting of both on- and off-site bores and groundwater monitoring well installations was performed by LRM Consulting and submitted in  September 2017.  Findings of the study will be presented in a meeting to be held on November 9th, 2017.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The former Nestlé facility, originally constructed by American Creamery in 1915, was used to manufacture ice cream and packaged milk. Carnation purchased the property in 1929 and made additions and improvements between 1946 and 1973 for dairy product processing and distribution.  Nestlé USA, Inc. assumed operation of the property following its purchase of Carnation in 1985.  Nestlé ceased operations at the property in 1992.  While it was operational, the facility was used for the distribution of ice cream and packaged fresh  milk by trucks. The delivery trucks were fueled at dispensers near service bays located at the  northwest corner and were repaired and maintained at the facility.    A chronological summary of historical operations at the facility and remedial actions and at the Site is provided below. Following development by Carnation, facilities included food processing equipment, large cooler\/freezer rooms, and five (5) underground storage tanks (USTs; two (2) gasoline, two (2)  diesel, one (1) waste oil) for delivery vehicles.      1980s  • Ice cream manufacturing and distribution activities declined in the late 1980s.  • In early 1988, ice cream and milk distribution ceased.  • In December 1988 and January 1989, five USTs were excavated and removed from the Site.  • Free product was observed in the tank excavation area during UST removal.  • Approximately 1,200 cubic yards of soil removed during UST excavation, treated on-site, and  replaced in excavation.    1990s  • Additional remediation efforts were implemented in the early 1990s.  • A soil vapor extraction (SVE) system operated in the former UST area from January 1994  through 1995, removing approximately 34,000 pounds of hydrocarbons.  • A multi-phase extraction system operated from August 1997 through June 2000, removing  10,875 pounds of hydrocarbons.  • Active remediation terminated in November 1999, with the concurrence of ACHA and the  Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Francisco (RWQCB-SF), in response to reductions  in LPH measurements.  • Nestlé monitored a network of 11 monitoring wells for petroleum hydrocarbons and halogenated volatile organic compounds (HVOCs) in groundwater semi-annually for two years.    2000s  • Operation of the multi-phase extraction system terminated in June 2000.  • A Risk Management Plan (RMP) and deed restriction were recorded.  • Nestlé sold the Site to Encinal 14th Street, LLC in July 2000.  • Nestlé submitted a Comprehensive Site Characterization Report to ACHA in January 2001 in  support of its request for Site closure.  • Nestlé submitted a Request for Case Closure to ACHA in February 2002.  • All unused wells were properly abandoned in December 2002.  • Nestlé submitted Site closure request follow-up letters to the ACHA on June 12, 2006 and June  15, 2007.  • In response to ACHS’s September 28, 2007 directive, Nestlé performed and submitted results  of additional field sampling in March and July 2008.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Historical records indicate a service station which had operated from approximately 1946, was demolished in 1978, and that second generation USTs and associated structures were removed.  First generation USTs appear to have been installed further to the northeast, beneath present day San Leandro Street.  In March and April 1987 bores DH-1 to DH-11 were installed.  Bores DH-1, DH-2, and DH-4 were converted to wells MW-1, MW-2, and MW-4 respectively.  In May 1988 wells MW-5 to MW-8 were installed, and a GPR survey was conducted; no USTs were located.  In November 1989 bores SB-1 to SB-6 and wells MW-9 and MW-10 were installed.  In April 1996 23 soil bores were installed (SB-1 to SB-23).  In May 1996 water supply wells P1 and P2 were located on an immediately adjacent downgradient facility.  P1 was found to provide process supply water and P2 was an emergency fire supply well; both were operational.  Water supply well P3 was located on an upgradient site at a distance of 250 ft.  In October 1997 soil vapor bores (SV-1 to SV-6) were collected and elevated concentrations were encountered in some bores.  In July 1998 a Tier 2 RBCA evaluation was conducted.  In January 2001 a Risk Management Plan was generated, and in November 2001 an additional Tier 2 RBCA evaluation was conducted; elevated vapor concentrations were considered anomalous.  In 2011 soil vapor wells VP-1 to VP-5 were installed, and in late 2015 soil bores SB-24 to SB-34 were installed.  A request for Closure was submitted in June 2016, was denied and a subsequent scope of work has been identified due to elevated soil vapor concentrations, including methane concentrations within, and above, the methane explosive range.  The site is currently used as a semi-truck staging and parking area.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "PROJECT BACKGROUND:  The Oakland Uptown Mixed Use site is bounded by San Pablo Avenue to the west, Telegraph Avenue to the east, Thomas L. Berkley Way (formerly 20th Street) to the north, and 19th Street to the south.  For development purposes, the property has been separated into four parcels (see figure below).  The development is scheduled to be completed in two phases, with Parcels 1, 2 and 3 included in the first phase and Parcel 4 in the second phase.  The current development plans indicate that each of the parcels will primarily consist of multi-unit residential buildings with some ground-level retail space in Parcels 3 and 4.  A 25,000 square-foot public park is planned for the western third of Parcel 4, but will be completed during the first phase of development.     ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS:  The combination of historical land use information and chemical data from soil, groundwater, and soil gas samples indicates three primary environmental issues:  • Lead and motor oil-range petroleum hydrocarbons are present in soils at multiple locations and depths across the site.   • Petroleum hydrocarbons and associated chemicals from a former service station are present in soil and groundwater at Parcel 4.    • Low levels of chlorinated solvents are present in groundwater, primarily in the western portion of the site, and are likely from unidentified, off-site sources.  Studies conducted in 2004 concluded that petroleum affected soil and groundwater at Parcel 4, as well as soil with lead and motor oil-range petroleum hydrocarbons at specific areas of Parcels 1 and 3, present a potential risk to future residents if left unmitigated.  In addition, the studies determined that chlorinated solvents in groundwater could present a potential risk to human health if affected groundwater were to intrude into the lower level of the future subterranean parking garages.    PROPOSED REMEDIAL ACTIONS AND RISK MANAGEMENT MEASURES:  The following remedial actions are proposed to reduce concentrations of lead and petroleum-related chemicals in soil and shallow groundwater to safe levels:  • Removal of near-surface contaminated soils across the site and truck transport of soils for off-site disposal  • Extraction of chemical-affected groundwater and soil vapors at Parcel 4    In addition, risk management measures are proposed to safely manage chemical-affected soil and groundwater encountered during and after construction.  These include:  • Storm water pollution and dust controls  • Safe treatment and disposal techniques for construction-phase dewatering  • Waterproofing of subterranean parking levels that extend into groundwater  • Health and Safety Plans for construction workers  • Long-term restrictions on groundwater use",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is located at the northeast corner of the 14th Street and Union Street intersection in Oakland, California, and was formerly occupied by a Shell-branded service station. An abandoned one-story service station building occupies the site. The City of Oakland has zoned the site for residential use. Land use in the surrounding area is residential to the north, south, and east, and is commercial\/industrial to the west and southwest. The site topography is essentially flat.    Beginning in 1993, the ACDEH requested active remediation of soil and groundwater at this site. From 2011 through 2013, active remediation consisting of operation of a combined dual-phase extraction (DPE) and air-sparge (AS) system with bio-organic catalyst injections was performed. In addition, 558 tons of petroleum-impacted soil were excavated and removed from the site in 1995, and approximately 685 tons of petroleum impacted soil were removed in 2015. The case history is summarized in the following timeline of ACDEH cleanup oversight actions:  1993 - Directed investigation and cleanup and recommended additional excavation of contaminated soil.  1994 - The property owner and former operators (Andy Saberi, Pawan Garg, Som Gupta, and Shell Oil Co.) disagreed on responsibility for the cleanup, each alleging that the other parties were responsible.  1995 - Alameda County’s District Attorney sued Saberi, Garg, Gupta and Shell Oil for failure to comply with ACDEH’s directives. A settlement agreement between the parties identified Shell Oil Co as the remediation lead.  1996 - Directed additional remedial investigation.  1997 - Directed additional investigation and interim remediation.  2000 - Requested a SCM to guide selection of the best method to remediate the site.  2001 - Reviewed a SVE pilot test report and denied Shell’s proposal to perform a RBCA analysis. ACDEH requested additional investigation and cleanup.  2002 - Directed additional investigation and a corrective action plan (CAP) for active remediation.   2002 - Requested access to the downgradient residential properties for further investigation.   2002 - Public notice and comment period conducted prior to ACDEH approval of Shell’s CAP.  2003-2004 - Oversaw hydrogen peroxide injection and dual-phase extraction (DPE) testing by Shell.  2007 - Shell determined that DPE was not feasible, and Saberi disagreed. Saberi sued Shell Oil, Garg, and Gupta. The 1995 settlement agreement was subsequently modified to identify Saberi as the remediation lead.  2008 - Oversaw preparation of the revised CAP for the site, including DPE and air sparging (AS).  2011 through 2013 - Oversaw operation of a DPE\/AS system and bio-organic catalyst injections at the site. The system actively removed petroleum compounds from the subsurface and increased biological activity in site groundwater to expedite biodegradation of petroleum.  2015 - Issued a Late Letter for failure to provide a workplan for soil excavation. Oversaw soil excavation to groundwater in the location of former fuel dispensers.  2016 - Report of excavation activities was submitted to the ACDEH.  2017 - Report of post-remediation groundwater sampling was submitted to the ACDEH.  2018 - Verification sampling was performed.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "One June 17, 1987, Kaprealian Engineering, Inc. (KEI) collected five soil samples following the removal of three USTs at the site.  Following the UST removals, KEI installed three groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-3) on May 6, 1988.  Elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in groundwater samples.  On January 24 and 25, 1990, Eight soil borings were completed to delineate extent of contamination.  Free phase petroleum hydrocarbons were detected at the site.  On May 17, 1990, Alton Geoscience installed two borings and converted one into a 2-inch diameter groundwater monitoring well (AW-1) and one 6-inch diameter recovery well (RW-1) and in July 1990, aquifer testing was conducted.  On February 27 and 28, 1991, Alton Geoscience oversaw installation of two on-site and two off-site soil borings.  Two on-site borings were converted into 4-inch diameter GW monitoring wells AW-5 and AW-6.  Two off-site borings were converted into 2-inch diameter GW monitoring wells AW-7 and AW-8 with additional aquifer testing performed on April 26, 1991.   In April 1992, a vapor extraction test was conducted using vapor extraction wells VW-1 through VW-3 to evaluate the feasibility of using vapor extraction as a remedial alternative. Also, in april 1994, a passive floating product removal system was intalled in RW-1. In November 1994, a SVE and groundwater treatment system began operation. these systems reportedly operated intermittently until December 1998.  On December 3, 1996, soil boring AW-9 was installed off-site in Warner Avenue approximately 300 feet southeast of the site under the supervision of Alisto and converted to GW monitoring well AW-9.  Cambria supervised the installation of 6 borings on the southeastern property line on October 22 and 23, 2001, which detected free-phase concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons.  In July and September 2005, URS supervised the installation of two borings (SB-1 &amp; SB-2) to evaluate possible preferential pathways.  A Feasibility Study recommending pilot testing of nitrate\/sulfate injection has been approved.",

Contaminants of concern include heavy metal slag - apparently imported from off-site - and paint chips and oil left by former on-site industrial activities.  Leachability tests on the slag indicate the presence of lead and copper.   These two constituents have been detected in the Beach Area at levels exceeding the Water Boards environmental screening levels.  As the Responsible Party, the City of Oakland's (City) ability to cleanup these contaminants is substantially constrained by available bond money.  Because sufficient cleanup cannot be achieved,  the City indicated that access to the Beach Area will prohibited.  However, development plans will prevent direct contact exposure to the upland slag areas by excavating and covering the slag area either with concrete or a subsurface warning barrier covered by at least one foot of fill.  The City has been reviewing and finalizing landscaping plans for the park for the past few months and will probably proceed with the redevelopment some time this year. A No Further Action Required letter was issued by the Regional Water Board March 30, 2011.

ACEH is not in agreement with the SWRCB's recommendation for closure as documented in an email correspondence dated 5\/14\/2012.     Subsequent to the end of the Public Comment Period on 9\/13\/2013, the SWQCB issued ORDER WQ 2013-097-UST dated 9\/30\/2013 ordering closure of the case after completion of monitoring well destruction and waste removal activities.     The Order requires the following:    1) RP submittal of well destruction and waste removal documentation to the Alameda County Environmental Health's Local Oversight Agency within six month from the date of the Order (March 30, 2014).    2) ACEH notification to the SWRCB within 30 days of receipt of well destruction and waste removal documentation that the tasks have been satisfactorily completed.    3) SWRCB issuance of a closure letter within 30 days of notification from ACEH of completion of the well destruction and waste removal activities.    Site History Summary: In September 1988, one 550-gallon steel waste oil UST was removed from the site by Kaprealian Engineering.  In October 1989, Alton Geoscience oversaw the installation of three GW monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-3) to verify potential impacts to GW following the removal the WO UST.  In 1990, new USTs, dispenser islands, and canopy were installed at the site.  In November 1994, EMCON conducted a site assessment that consisted of collecting two discrete soil samples (TD-1 and TD-3).I In May 1999, Cambria performed a well recovery test. In July 2005, five borings (SB-4 through SB-8) were installed by URS to further characterize the subsurface hydrocarbon contamination at the site. In October 2007, URS advanced three off-site borings (SB-1, SB-2, and SB-3) between the site and the storm drain under MacArthur Boulevard, and one on-site soil boring (SB-4A).  In September 2010 ARCADIS installed one downgradient monitoring well (MW-4). Currently, downgradient extent of contamination has not been assessed.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is the Golden Gate Petroleum Oakland Cardlock, a commercial facility with a warehouse and two operating 20,000-gallon underground storage tanks (USTs) and supporting dispensers in Oakland, CA.  Surrounding land use is commercial and industrial.  The site has supplied retail motor vehicle fuels since 1976.    In August 1998, one 8,000-gallon UST and four 12,000-gallon USTs along with the associated product lines and dispensers were removed.  The five USTs were replaced with two 20,000-gallon double wall, steel, fiberglass-reinforced USTs.  During the 1998 tank removal, approximately 1,300 cubic yards of contaminated soil beneath the tanks, product lines, and dispensers was excavated and disposed off-site.  During and after the excavation, 49 soil samples and one groundwater sample were collected.   Soil samples collected prior to excavation contained up to 18,000 ppm of total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), 22,000 ppm of TPHd, 67 ppm of benzene, 1,800 ppm of toluene, 370 ppm of ethylbenzene, 2,200 ppm of total xylenes, and 880 ppm of MTBE.  Contaminated soils were excavated to the top of the groundwater surface, at a total depth of approximately 11 feet bgs.  Final confirmation soil samples collected from the former dispenser island excavations contained up to 1.9 ppm of MTBE, 240 ppm of TPHg, 1,400 ppm of TPHd, 0.35 ppm of benzene, 0.9 ppm of toluene, 1.4 ppm of ethylbenzene, and 2.8 ppm of total xylenes.   Final confirmation soil samples collected from the base and sidewall of the tank pit excavation contained up to 7.3 ppm of MTBE, 8.2 ppm of TPHg, 0.01 ppm of benzene, 0.008 ppm of toluene, and 0.007 ppm of total xylenes.  Approximately 28,000 gallons of groundwater was pumped from the excavation into holding tanks.  Free-phase product was observed on the surface of the groundwater.  A portion of the water and free-phase product was disposed off-site and the remainder was discharged to the sanitary sewer.  A collection trench and two extraction casings were installed within the tank backfill in the former tank cavity for possible groundwater extraction.    In October 1999, Hageman &amp; Aguiar collected soil and grab groundwater samples from eight direct-push soil borings located throughout the site.  TPHg and TPHd were detected in grab groundwater samples at concentrations up to 12,000 and 620,000 ppb, respectively.  MTBE was detected in the grab groundwater samples at concentrations up to 13,000 ppb.  Based on the results of the direct-push soil borings, four groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-4) were installed on November 1, 1999.  An additional three groundwater monitoring wells (MW-5 through MW-7) were installed on July 28, 2000.    The seven monitoring wells were sampled from 1999 to 2002 and were again sampled in December 2007.  MTBE was reported in the off-site monitoring wells southwest of the site at concentrations up to 2,400 ppb.  MTBE concentrations in groundwater showed significant decreases over time.  The maximum concentration of MTBE reported during the initial sampling event in November 1999 was 13,000 ppb; the maximum concentration of MTBE reported during the last sampling event in December 2007 was 320 ppb.    A soil vapor survey was conducted at the site on December 16, 2008.  TPHg, BTEX, and MTBE were not detected in soil vapor at concentrations above reporting limits.  The reporting limit for benzene in soil vapor was 0.5 micrograms per liter (µg\/L) which exceeds the Environmental Screening Level (San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, May 2008) for soil vapor under a commercial land use scenario of 0.28 µg\/L.  Based on the lack of detections for all petroleum hydrocarbons in soil vapor, results from groundwater sampling, and the age of the release, vapor intrusion does not appear to be a significant concern for commercial land use at the site.  Tetrachloroethene (PCE) was detected in one soil vapor sample (GP-8) at a concentration of 4.71 µg\/L.  PCE storage or use was not reported on site.  The source of the PCE in groundwater is unknown but potentially may be related to an off-site source.    On January 13, 2009, two direct-push soil borings (GP-A and GP-B) were advanced on site adjacent to sampling locations where elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were previously detected in soil and groundwater.  Soil and grab groundwater sampling results from borings GP-A and GP-B indicated that concentrations of TPHg, BTEX, and MTBE had decreased significantly between 1999 and 2009.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "A report entitled, “Soil and Ground-water Contamination, 569 High Street, Oakland, California,” and dated July 24, 1987, describes the results from three soil borings advanced in the western portion of the parcel at 569 High Street.  Harding Lawson Associates prepared the July 24, 1987 Report for the City of Oakland Real Estate Division.  The July 24, 1987 Report indicates that the area of investigation included “three oil-stained areas,” which appeared to be the result of surface spills.  A total of four soil samples that were collected from the three soil borings did not contain total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd) at concentrations above the reporting limit of 20 milligrams per kilogram.  However, TPHd was detected in groundwater samples collected from each of the three soil borings at concentrations up to 600,000 micrograms per liter (µg\/L).  Benzene was detected in groundwater samples collected from two of the three soil borings at concentrations up to 8,700 µg\/L.  Xylenes were detected in groundwater samples collected from each of the three soil borings at concentrations up to 420,000 µg\/L.  The concentrations of TPHd, benzene, and xylenes in the groundwater samples significantly exceed Environmental Screening Levels (San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board updated February 2013).  Environmental Screening Levels provide a tiered approach to evaluating risk for a site.  The presence of petroleum hydrocarbon constituents at concentrations that exceed Environmental Screening Levels does not necessarily indicate that adverse impacts to human health or the environment are occurring.  However, further investigation is needed to assess the extent of contamination and whether contamination at 569 High Street could pose a risk to current or future users of the site. The case is currently inactive.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Department  Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    This case was opened in 2015 to address Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as motor oil (TPHmo) contamination along an abandoned railroad spur located on the property.  The contamination was discovered in a soil sampling event in June 1988 for a proposed redevelopment project (former case RO0002664) which documented historic rail spur contamination to be present in near surface soil at the site.   Subsequent to sampling event, the proposed redevelopment site was subdivided into six smaller parcels and each redeveloped (34-2300-19, 34-2300-20,34-2300-21, 34-2300-22, 34-2300-23, and 34-2300-24.  This case (RO0003177 Tidewater Subsite, Global Id T10000007146) was opened subsequent to the parcel split to address the TPHmo contamination on APN 34-2300-19.  Case number RO0002664 for the remaining five parcels was closed without further investigation.    This parcel is currently developed as a commercial property on fill marshlands along the bay margin.  The subject parcel is entirely capped with pavement and a building, with a landscaped area in the eastern third of the parcel in the location of the former rail spur alignment.    Potential source areas associated with the former rail tracks were investigated and analyzed for petroleum hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds (VOC; full analytical suite), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and metals in soil and groundwater.  Downgradient soil and grab groundwater samples were also collected.    The analytical results detected TPHmo, TPH as diesel, and metals in soil, and dissolved metals in groundwater.  Although the site is not documented to have contained an underground storage tank (UST), this case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  The LTCP states that it is appropriate to apply the policy to other petroleum releases.  Closure of the case under the LTCP for petroleum compounds appears appropriate with a commercial land use restriction to manage limited residual petroleum contamination at the site.    The non-petroleum contamination has been evaluated consistent with criteria described in the Regional Water Board’s Environmental Screening Level Tables, in conjunction with User’s Guide: Derivation and Application of Environmental Screening Levels, revised in March 2016.    Case closure is granted for the current commercial land use.    Due to limited residual subsurface contamination remaining at the site, if any redevelopment occurs, or if a change in land use to residential, or other conservative land use, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.    Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    This site is to be entered into the City of Oakland Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.",

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm    The subject site is located at 640 Brooklyn Avenue in Oakland, CA. The site is currently used as a residential apartment complex in a residential neighborhood. The subject site is at an elevation of approximately 95 feet above mean sea level (amsl). Lake Merritt, the closest surface water body, is located approximately 1,100 feet west of the property at an elevation of approximately 4 feet amsl. The direction of groundwater flow in the area appears to be west towards Lake Merritt.    One 750-gallon underground storage tank (UST) containing residual diesel fuel was discovered beneath the sidewalk along Brooklyn Avenue in front of the subject site during a Phase I environmental site assessment. Soil discoloration and petroleum hydrocarbon odor was observed during removal of the UST on February 19, 2013.  Holes were observed in the UST during removal and the soil sample collected beneath the UST detected 4,820 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd). The UST was situated 8 feet below ground surface (bgs), measured 8 feet in length by 4 feet in width, and was constructed of single-wall bare steel. Over-excavation around the former tank location was conducted to 16 feet bgs on March 27, 2013. Two confirmation soil samples collected from the base of the excavation detected 875 mg\/kg TPHd in the western sample and 227 mg\/kg TPHd in the eastern sample. Approximately 7.85 tons of over-excavated soil was transported offsite for proper disposal. Stockpiled overburden, along with 10 yards of clean imported, was used to backfill the excavation. Groundwater was not encountered during the excavation.      In February 2014 four soil borings, SB-1 through SB-4, were advanced through and on three sides of the former UST location.  No analytes were detected above the laboratory detection limits in soil samples except SB-2 at 4 feet bgs detected 1.3 mg\/kg TPHd.    Water was encountered in SB-1 at a depth of 12 feet bgs and was thought to be perched water at the interface between the gravel UST pit backfill and the native silty clay.  TPHd was detected at 2,000 micrograms per liter (ug\/L) in the water sample, however, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and total xylenes (BTEX), methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), or naphthalene were not detected above the laboratory detection limits in the water sample.    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP).  Based on this evaluation, no site management requirements appear to be necessary.  However, excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    This site is to be entered into the City of Oakland Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.",

On June 1, 2011, the trench plate and several cubic yards of pea gravel surrounding the UST were removed.  The City of Oakland was there to observe the tank removal.  No corrosion, odor, holes or soil discoloration was observed by the city of Oakland personnel.  One four-point composite soil sample was collected from the excavation.  The samples were collected from pea gravel located between 10 and 12 feet below ground surface.  The soil sample was analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), and total lead.  TPHd was detected at a concentration of 5.0 ppm.

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    In June 1997 a baseline property transaction investigation was completed at an existing service station at this location.  Wells MW-1 to MW-3 had been installed in May 1997 as a part of this investigation.  In April 1999 offsite well MW-4 was installed.  In January 2002 offsite wells MW-5 and MW-6 were installed.  Soil bores B-1 to B-8 (B-5 was not installed) were installed in June 2012 to advance the case towards closure.    Previously case review indicated that TPHd and TPH mo had not been included in analytical program in soil or groundwater associated with the former waste oil UST.  The more recent analytical results indicated elevated concentrations of potential concern (38,000 ug\/l TPHmo and 19,000 ug\/l TPHd) in groundwater.  The use of Silica Gel Cleanup indicated that a significant concentration of degradation products was included in the extractable hydrocarbon analysis.  Onsite groundwater concentrations were reduced to 13,000 ug\/l TPHmo with Silica Gel Cleanup.  The extent of TPHmo in groundwater appears to be predominately onsite.    The removal of the secondary source at the former waste oil UST location has not been determined and the site fails the Low Threat Closure Policy (LTCP) due to this.  However, maintenance or construction workers employed at the facility are required by California regulations to be trained in health and safety concerns associated with volatile motor fuels, and thus are expected to be prepared for potential exposures in their standard work routines.  Potential exposures to the general public are expected to be transitory and could occur only while temporarily present for the purpose of fueling their vehicles or obtaining related automotive services.  As an active fueling station the site is entirely paved except for limited areas around the perimeter of the site, and exposure to site soils is prevented, except in controlled conditions under the current commercial land use as an active service station.  Therefore the case has been closed under the LTCP.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "1992: An initial environmental investigation was conducted to determine whether soil near the product lines and USTs had been impacted by  petroleum hydrocarbons.    July 1993: One single-walled 10,000-gallon gasoline UST, one single-walled 6,000-gallon gasoline UST, and one 550-gallon waste oil UST, were removed and replaced them with the three double-walled USTs currently beneath the Site: one 10,000-gallon gasoline UST, and two 6,000-gallon gasoline  USTs.    December 1997: Additional investigations and quarterly groundwater monitoring were conducted.    April 1999: Groundwater monitoring, riskbased corrective action (RBCA) and corrective action plan (CAP) studies, and soil and groundwater remediation were conducted. RBCA study categorized the site as a high-risk groundwater site, thereby warranting soil and groundwater remediation on and off-site.    August 1999: A French drain and groundwater treatment system was installed to prevent further migration of chemically impacted groundwater. This treatment  system has been in operation since early December 1999.    July 2000: A vapor extraction system was installed.      January 2002: Product dispensers were removed and replaced.    July 25, 2003: An additional on-site extraction pump was installed n the western French drain riser to create a capture zone around the USTs and contain off-site migration in the southwestern corner of the site.    November 17 to 23, 2005: Air sparge and vapor extraction wells were installed.    February 22 to March 6, 2006: An air sparge system was installed.    February 5, 2007: An extraction well, EX-1, was installed in the vicinity of the UST cavity due to the continued significant contaminant source within this region.  The well diameter is 4 inches with an approximate depth of 20 feet.    December 2007 to October 2008: Following a pilot test in December 2007, six monthly multi-phase extraction (MPE) events were conducted from March through October 2008.    November 2008: Soil vapor sampling was conducted at the site on November 14, 2008.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site has five Areas of Concern (AOC).  AOC1 is along the southern property line west of a workshop and consists of a release of TPHd, TPHmo, and TPHk in shallow soil.  AOC2 is located along the western property line immediately east of the railroad right-of-way to the further to the west.  It consists of a release of TPHmo to shallow soil which also includes PCB contamination.  AOC3 is in the northwestern corner of the site and consists of PCB contamination.    AOC4 is in the south-central part of the site and is associated with former gasoline and waste oil USTs that were removed at an unknown date in the past.  An additional separate release of motor oil also appears to be located within this AOC.  AOC5 is located in the east-central portion of the site, and is associated with a former gasoline UST that has not been confirmed to have been removed, and is located beneath a newer large warehouse building.    In AOC2 and 3 four exploratory pits were excavated along the western property line in July 1987.  The pits were enlarged in November 1987 and the excavations were judged complete.  In October 1991 bores B1 to B5 were installed to investigate the extent of removal conducted in the 1987 excavations.  Bores B6 and B7 were installed in later 1991 to investigate an asphalt and concrete area.  In AOC4 a 550-gallon gasoline UST was removed in late 1992, and a previous removal in another area is understood to have occurred in 1954.  In November 1992 wells MW-1 to MW-4 were installed, and well MW-5 was installed in August 1994 (now in AOCs 3, 4, and 5).  In June 2008 nine hand augers were installed, soil gas well SG-1 was installed, and Geoprobe bores GP-1 to GP-8 were installed.  In early 2009 two air sparging wells (AS-1D and ASMW2-D) were installed, wells MW-6 and MW-7 were installed, and MIP-1 to MIP-6 were installed, and some remedial actions were conducted (AOC4).  Well MW-8, and pilot test wells E-1 to E-12 were installed in 2010, generally in the AOC4 area.  A one day DPE pilot test was conducted in April 2010, and a full scale HVDPE pilot test was conducted in June 2010.  Significant vapor concentrations were extracted.  Groundwater monitoring wells MW-9 to MW-13 were installed in phases between 2013 and 2018 to define the downgradient extent of AOC4 contamination.  Soil vapor wells were installed in 2013, and subslab vapor pins in 2018 in AOCs 4 and 5.",

The Phase II had been prepared as part of a due diligence for a property transaction. Currently, the parcel, APN 25-693-3-3, is a fenced, vacant lot.  The Phase II includes a summary of the recognized environmental conditions (RECs) from a March 2001 Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Report (Phase I), which states that the site was previously the location of a “gas &amp; oil” facility most likely associated with a former automotive dealership that occupied the site from at least 1946 until approximately 1959. In July 2002, a geophysical survey revealed three areas of disturbed soil, which may be indicative of excavations associated with the former locations of underground storage tanks (USTs), product lines, and dispensers. A subsurface metallic object identified as a possible UST with the approximate dimensions of a 550-gallon UST was found and may be a waste oil UST.  In August 2002, three soil borings were advanced at the site to a depth of 16 feet below grade, but groundwater was not encountered. Concentrations of up to 49 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) and 630 mg\/kg TPH as diesel (TPHd) were documented in soil samples. ACDEH has requested a Data Gap Work Plan to investigate the site.",

In May 2019 additional subsurface investigations were conducted to evaluate the release of petroleum-related contaminants of concern (COCs) (RO0003231) and non-petroleum chlorinated COCs (RO0003353) at the site and to support the preparation of a complete Site Conceptual Model (SCM).  Investigations to evaluate petroleum-related COCs included the lateral and vertical delineation of shallow groundwater downgradient of the former underground storage tank (UST) area.   Investigations to evaluate non-petroleum-related chlorinated COCs included the further evaluation of potential vapor intrusion risk to the adjacent offsite (residential) receptors; further assessment of the nature and extent of non-petroleum sub-slab soil vapor impacts north of SSV-2; and evaluation of preferential pathways (floor drains, etc) for potential vapor intrusion to indoor air.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is an active container port owned by the city of Oakland.  The site is located at 2700 7th Street in Oakland, California, adjacent to the Oakland Outer Harbor.  Historical and current land use at, and in the vicinity of the site, is commercial and industrial.  The Port of Oakland shipping terminals are located along this and the adjacent waterfront properties to the north, west, and south.  The case was opened in 1989 following the removal of a UST that experienced an unauthorized release of petroleum hydrocarbons.    According to Port of Oakland personnel, the site was initially developed by Albers Milling Company until the 1940’s when it was purchased by the Carnation Company.  In 1984, Carnation ceased operations at the site and it remained vacant until 1988, Port of Oakland demolished the buildings to facilitate shipping terminal expansion.      On November 28, 1988, one 15,000-gallon steel UST located at the eastern end of the facility was removed from the site.  A total of four soil samples were collected following the excavation of the UST.   Soil sample TA-1 collected at the southern end of the tank excavation included concentrations of TPH-g at 3,800 mg\/kg, 1.1 mg\/kg benzene, 7.4 mg\/kg  toluene, 2.5 mg\/kg ethyl benzene, and 116 mg\/kg xylenes, and unspecified hydrocarbons at 2,600 mg\/kg.  A grab groundwater sample detected TPH at a concentration of 2,400 µg\/L.      Approximately 35 cubic yards of soil from the southern end of the excavation was removed and a soil sample (South End) collected from the vicinity of TA-1.  The South End soil sample detected TPH at a concentration of 220 mg\/kg. The stockpiled soil was divided into eight sections.  Composite Sample 1 consisted of samples S1, S2, and S4.  Composite Sample 2 consisted of samples S5, S6, S7, and S8.  The remaining sample (S3) was analyzed individually based on field observations indicating potential presence of hydrocarbon contamination.  Soil sample analytical results detected 340 mg\/kg TPH in stockpiled soil sample S3, while the other two samples did not contain hydrocarbons above the laboratory detection limit.  The clean stockpiles were replaced back into the excavation, while the S3 stockpile and the over-excavated soil was disposed off-site.  A second groundwater sample was collected from the bottom of the excavation.  Groundwater sample analytical results did not detect contaminants above the laboratory detection limit.      An investigation was performed in 2018 which included a geophysical survey for tank pit identification and advancing five soil bores in the vicinity of the geophysical anomaly thought to be the location of the former 15,000-gallon UST.  The borings were advanced for the collection of soil and grab-groundwater (GGW) samples.   Groundwater was encountered at a depth of less than 10 feet bgs in all the bores, and four of the five GGW samples were reported to contain concentrations of TPHd exceeding the San Francisco Bay region RWQCB Environmental Screening Level (ESL) for Direct Exposure Human Health Risk.  The maximum TPHd concentration was report at 588 ug\/L with TPHd concentrations appear to increase away from the UST anomaly as evidenced by GGW from bore B4 and bore B5.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The subject site (the Site) is located near the southeast intersection of Lowell Street and east bound lane of Stanford Ave in a mixed residential and industrial\/commercial area of the Santa Fe neighborhood of Oakland and consists of one parcel identified by Alameda County Assessor Parcel Number (APN) -15-1294-1.  The property is bound to north by Stanford Ave and further by residential homes; to the east and south by the backyards of residential single-family homes and further by commercial and industrial properties; and to the west(adjacent) by an industrial property with a former Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Case RO0002983 Willbett Company, closed in October 2011. Case closure records for the former LUST case indicate one 425-gallon underground storage tank (UST), one 1,300-gallon UST and one 650-gallon above ground storage tank (AST) were removed from property in March and April 2008, respectively. Residual soil and groundwater impacts of diesel and motor oil range total petroleum hydrocarbon exists beneath the property adjacent to the Site.     The site remained unoccupied from approximately 2013 until late 2017 when the onsite building was demolished and a new two-story commercial building was being constructed at the Site. In July 2019 a fire burned the northern 1\/3 portion of the 2-story commercial building being constructed.  Construction activities have been halted at the Site since the July 2019 fire.    Historical operations at the Site included various industrial and commercial printing companies from at least the 1950's to approximately 2013. Limited information, maps, and aerials regarding historical operations were available for the Site from between 1911 to 1951.  A review of hazardous material records for the Site indicate the incineration of 0.025 tons of metal sludge in 1993, and the reclaiming 0.0036 tons of an unspecified solvent mixture and storing of 0.3 tons of organic solids in 2013.    Based on review of aerial photographs and SanBorn fire insurance maps, the Site contained various residences in the eastern portion of the property and storage building on the southern portion of the property in 1911. Various residentials properties were observed adjacent to the Site in 1911.  Sanborn map from 1903 indicates the Site was vacant land with residences on adjoining properties.    Two Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (Phase 1) were conducted for the Site in 2013 and 2019, respectively.   The 2013 Phase I indicated evidence of a possible UST located in the sidewalk on the northern portion of the Site.  The 2013 Phase 1 reported the observation of a small, round, metal lid covering what appeared to be a fill port for a UST, as well as heavily cracked and sunken pavement within the sidewalk in the vicinity of an associated fill port. The location where the fill port was discovered in the 2013 Phase I was noted to be covered over by cement during the 2019 Phase I.  Currently, no geophysical or subsurface investigations have been performed at the Site.  The 2013 Phase I also indicated the previous tenants had received numerous violations regarding the storage and handling of hazardous waste on Site. Improper storage and handling of hazardous waste, significant staining and cracking observed in the vicinity of patched section of concrete slab floor inside the building were also noted.    Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) entered into a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement (VRAA) on April 17, 2020 to provide regulatory oversight of subsurface investigations activities conducted at the Site.    A review of redevelopment plans for the Site indicate the proposed redevelop will consists of eight residential units (Unit A through Unit H) with an associated subterranean parking garage.",

Sometime before 1911, the portion of the  creek crossing the Site was re-aligned along the northerly property margin, and a larger residence  and nursery structures were constructed near the site of the earlier residence on the nursery  grounds. In addition, an Oakland Public Library ‘Reading Room’ was constructed at the  southwest corner of the parcel. During the early 1920’s, four retail stores were constructed along  the Telegraph Avenue frontage of the property, replacing the library building. The nursery  residence remained on the northwest quadrant of the lot, however. Temescal Creek was culverted  and the channel filled in prior to 1939. The nursery and the three retail buildings were  demolished in the late 1960s, and the present structure was built in 1969 as a branch of the  American Savings Bank. The bank vacated the structure in the early 2000s, and the building was  occupied by a video store from 2004 until 2008.",

As of December 2018, the northern-most warehouse is used for storage, while the southern warehouse is used as an indoor fitness facility. The site is surrounded primarily by single-and multi-family residential housing.     Environmental investigations have been ongoing since 2000 and have included installation of a groundwater monitoring well network and collection of soil, groundwater and soil gas samples. Interim remedial excavation was conducted in 2009 inside the warehouse and immediately down-gradient of the former UST location; 1,100 tons of contaminated soil to a depth of 12 feet bgs was removed from an excavation measuring 35 feet by 75 feet. Based on meetings in 2018, ACDEH understands that the current property owner intends to sell the property. A Phase I Report was conducted to identify additional Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs) to inform investigation activities in areas where unexpected subsurface contamination has been discovered.    The chlorinated volatile organic compound tetrachloroethene (PCE) was detected in multiple soil vapor samples collected in September 2019 at a maximum concentration of 2,000 micrograms per cubic meter in the eastern corner of the property exceeding the commercial risk-based vapor intrusion screening levels for vapor intrusion risk of micrograms per cubic meter. PCE was detected along the property line with the adjacent residences at a concentration of 20 micrograms per cubic meter, exceeding the residential risk-based vapor intrusion screening levels for vapor intrusion risk of 15 micrograms per cubic meter. Due to leaks in the sampling train and elevated reporting limits in petroleum hydrocarbon source areas (such as VB-12 where PCE was not detected at an elevated reporting limit 3,500 micrograms per cubic meter), temporal and valid data has not been collected to evaluate the magnitude and extent of PCE in soil gas to evaluate whether the source of PCE is on or off-Site. Due to the presence of PCE reported in soil vapor samples at the Site, this Site Cleanup Program case was opened to investigate the presence and origin of the PCE.",

Four soil bores were installed in February 2007 to investigate subsurface conditions around the perimeter of what the previous owner had identified as the former location of the gasoline USTs.  A work plan for additional work was submitted in November 2007, and additional work was requested.  Since 2007 an extensive series of soil, groundwater, and soil vapor investigations have been conducted for the former service station, both on and offsite.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has been providing regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003423 since March 2020 subsequent to the associated property transaction.  To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as automobile service and repair operations with associated former underground storage tanks, and printing shop, and candy manufacturing.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil and soil vapor).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include the hazardous material survey and abatement of the existing onsite building and hardscape; demolition of existing Site buildings and above ground infrastructure; remediation and\/or off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes demolition of the existing warehouse building and existing parking lots and construction of three three-story buildings that will include 18 townhouse units. The development will also include extensive landscaping, including a shared courtyard, on-site parking, and long-term and short-term bicycle parking.      The Site is approximately 0.57-acres and includes one associated Assessor Parcel Number (APN) 3-47-9-1.  The current configuration at the Site consists of a two-story warehouse building and asphalt paved parking lots to the west and south of the building. The Site is surrounded by a mix of residential and commercial properties. The warehouse was constructed in the 1920s and was used as an automobile repair facility (1920s -1940s), printing operations (1930s -1940s), a candy factory (1950s - 1960s), a printing and machine shop (1970s),  a data processing facility (1990s-2000), and then as a SuperNutrition warehouse and office from 2000 until recently. The parking lots were historically occupied with homes from the 1900s until the 1970s.    Numerous environmental investigations have been conducted in 2019 and 2020 at or near the Site and indicate the presence of elevated levels of lead in shallow soil, diesel and motor oil range total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH-d and TPH-mo) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil and groundwater, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including tetrachloroethene (PCE) and chloroform in soil vapor resulting from historical operations that pre-date the current owner.      A Draft Corrective Action Plan (Draft CAP), dated November 9, 2020 has been submitted and is currently in review with Alameda County Department of Environmental Health.  Additionally a Fact Sheet inviting the public to review and comment on the Draft CAP to address historical environmental impacts was distributed to the surrounding community in English and Spanish on December 9, 2020.  A public meeting will be conducted on January 6, 2021 to inform the public more about Site conditions, the proposed corrective actions, discuss community protection measures, and answer questions and accept comments. Proposed corrective actions include remedial excavation of soil to depths of approximately 7  feet below the ground surface to facilitate the construction of foundation elements and remove historically contaminated soil; consolidation of lead-impacted material on-sitebeneath future buildings or hardscape or transporting lead-impacted soil to a licensed, off-Site disposal facility; and installation of a sub-slab vapor barrier and venting system beneath the planned building to prevent VOCs from entering indoor air.    Proposed redevelopment plans include demolition of the existing warehouse building and existing parking lots and construction of three three-story buildings that will include 18 townhouse units. The development will also include extensive landscaping, including a shared courtyard, on-site parking, and long-term and short-term bicycle parking.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site has been a service station since the 1950’s.  In 1967 a 2,000-gallon release was discovered, and the adjacent property owner complained about gasoline odors in their basement.  In 1980 the adjacent owner again complained about odors, and the USTs were replaced; however, they were found to be tight, and it was assumed air conditioning may have drawn in the vapors.  A sheet of plastic was placed between 0 and 14 – 16 feet deep onsite, as a barrier to minimize infiltration into the next door basement.  In May 1981 free-product was discovered, a 24-inch extraction well was installed, but appears not to have been used.  In 1984 station upgrades found two USTs in the sidewalk and they were abandoned in place with grout, and tenants next door again complained of odors.  Sheen was not seen on groundwater in the basement sump at that time; however, a 1985 sample of the sump water contained gasoline-related aromatic compounds.  In 1985 a stick hole in a gas UST was discovered, repaired, and the UST put back in service.  In 1991 a drive-off event occurred and a small volume of product was lost.  In 1991 all extant wells (except the 24-inch well), were destroyed due to damage from the 1984 upgrades, and onsite wells MW-1 to MW-4 were installed.  Groundwater monitoring was initiated at that time.  In July 1992 offsite wells MW-5 to MW-8 were installed.  In April 1999 offsite well MW-9 was installed, and wells MW-2 to MW-4 were abandoned and replaced with MW-2A to MW-4A.  Basement sump water was again sampled in 2005 and TPHD, TPHG, BTEX, and several oxygenates were detected; additional events were proposed but do not appear to have occurred.  In August 2006 two soil bores were installed offsite in an attempt to define the extent in soil to the northwest of the site.  In August 2010, four 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs were removed from the site and excavation and product line confirmation samples were collected, and documented soil contamination.  In November 2013 seven soil bores were installed on- and offsite, to help define the extent of the soil and groundwater plume.  Crawl space, sub-slab, and indoor air vapor samples were also collected at the adjacent downgradient properties, 3008 and 3014 Lakeshore Avenue.  In September and October 2016 soil bores B-8 to B-13 were installed onsite, and was well MW-10 was installed downgradient of the site.  Additional wells and soil bores across Lakeshore could not be installed as planned due to extensive underground utility locations.  Additional soil gas and indoor air sampling was conducted in March 2018 at the adjacent downgradient properties, and is planned again in 2019.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently an active gasoline service station located at the intersection of International Boulevard and 5th Avenue in Oakland, CA.  Surrounding land use is mixed commercial and residential.      A 550 gallon waste oil underground storage tank (UST) was removed on March 30, 1993.  No holes or leaks were identified during the removal.  Weiss Associates (Weiss) collected two soil samples from the excavation floor.  Total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), and oil and grease were detected in the samples.      On March 24, 1998, secondary containment was added to the UST turbine sumps.  Cambria Environmental Technology, Inc. (Cambria) inspected the turbine sump and tank pit areas and found no field indication of hydrocarbons, such as staining or odor.  No sampling was performed.      In late June through mid July 2004, Paradiso Mechanical, Inc. (Paradiso) upgraded under dispenser sumps, installed enhanced vapor recovery equipment, and improved sumps on the UST fuel fill ports.  Soil samples collected from beneath the dispensers and adjacent piping on July 22, 2004 contained up to 8,400 ppm TPHg (P 3 5’), 0.045 ppm benzene (P 2 5’), 52 ppm toluene (P 3 5’), 420 ppm ethylbenzene (P 3 5’), and 0.020 ppm xylenes (P 2 5’).  As a result, on July 29, 2004 Equilon Enterprises LLC dba Shell Oil Products US (Shell) filed an UST Unauthorized Release Report Form with the City of Oakland Fire Department’s Office of Emergency Services.    On October 18 and 19, 2005, soil and grab groundwater samples were collected from soil borings SB 1 through SB 7.  Grab groundwater samples contained up to ppb TPHg (SB 7: 20 25 feet below grade [fbg]), 24 ppb benzene (SB 7: 20 25 fbg), 140 ppb toluene (SB 7: 20 25 fbg), 110 ppb ethylbenzene (SB 7: 20 25 fbg), 1,000 ppb xylenes (SB 7: 20 25 fbg), 1,400 ppb Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE; SB 6: 25 27 fbg), and 3,200 ppb tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA; S 5: 15 25 fbg).    In July 2006, five groundwater monitoring wells (MW 1 through MW 5) were installed in the area around the dispensers and UST complex.  All analytical results for soil samples were below San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) environmental screening levels (ESLs) for sites at which groundwater is not a current or potential source of drinking water with the exception of 339 ppm TPHg detected in MW 4 at 10 fbg.    Quarterly groundwater monitoring was conducted at the site from August 2006 through November 2009.  During the most recent November 2009 sample event, the maximum concentrations detected were 140 ppb TPHg (MW 2), 90 ppb MTBE (MW 1), and 34 ppb TBA (MW 2).",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) is providing regulatory oversight of the proposed redevelopment project located at the subject site on Assessor Parcel Number 3-25-10 (760 22nd Street) and APN 3-25-11 (2201 Brush Street) in Oakland, California. The two parcels have historically been developed as residential or commercial properties including but not limited to truck storage and vehicle repair facilities. A 7,000 gallon diesel underground storage tank (UST) and a 2,000 gallon gasoline UST were removed from the northeastern corner of the site and adjacent city sidewalk in 1986. Other vehicle maintenance and fuel related infrastructure remains at the site including (1) a below grade pit, historically used for servicing large vehicles (trucks and buses) and referred to as the oil-changing pit located in the northern portion of an existing shop building (integral with the surrounding concrete floor of the building); (2) a small raised concrete pedestal located at the east-central edge of the site in the location of a former fuel dispenser; and (3) an area of unusually low-density soil and a nearby standpipe indicative of a UST vent pipe identified at the west central edge of the site and referred to as the geophysical anomaly area (presumed to be the former location of a UST possibly used for waste oil). Subsurface investigations conducted at the site between 2005 until 2016 have identified petroleum-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs), non-petroleum-related VOCs, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil, soil gas and groundwater.     East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation (EBALDC) plans to redevelop the site with an eight-story mixed-use facility (day care and affordable multi-family) residential development as shown on the preliminary plan set entitled West Grand &amp; Brush Street 90% Schematic Design Set prepared by Pyatok Architects and dated February 12, 2015. The project will include a second floor daycare center serving up to 130 children and ground floor offices for EBALDC’s social services, daycare offices, two separate elevator lobbies (one for residential entry and another for daycare entry), and an enclosed ground level parking garage with parking for 50 spaces. Two, 3-car high puzzle lifts will be constructed near the center of the property for below grade parking. Higher floors will be used for residential living with up to a maximum of 59 affordable residential units. All units with the exception of the manager’s unit will qualify as affordable housing serving residents with incomes at or below 60 percent of the area median income. At the date of this letter, ACDEH understands the 760 22nd Street parcel is developed with a one-story metal shop building, two mobile trailers and associated paved parking areas and is currently rented by O’Neill Trucking as a vehicle storage area. The parcel at 2201 Brush Street is unpaved and is also rented by O’Neill Trucking for vehicle storage.    A review of historic data in the case files and recently collected data and data evaluation indicate that there are three areas of residual contamination from releases associated with historic site use for truck storage and vehicle repair. To mitigate risks to future building occupants, the engineering and institutional controls have been proposed in the document entitled Remedial Action Plan, Properties at 760 22nd Street and 2201 Brush Street, Oakland (RAP), dated October 10, 2016 and prepared by Essel Environmental Engineering &amp; Consulting. The RAP was conditionally approved by ACDEH on June 6, 2017.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on Geotracker. A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm     This site is to be entered into the City of Oakland Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.    The subject site is currently in mixed commercial\/residential use and is comprised of two parcels, APN 9-682-1-1 and 9-682-1-2.   Parcel APN 9-682-1-2 is located at 2633 Telegraph Avenue and is occupied by the three-story former Sears retail center including a basement.  The retail center was built in 1930 and an approved December 1940 building permit indicated the possible addition of a “tire and oil shop” on the west side of the retail center.  The ground floor is currently in commercial use and the upper floors are in residential use.  APN 9-682-1-1 is the site of the former above ground parking structure for the Sears retail center built in the early 1960’s and is currently not in use.  Lake Merritt, the closest surface water body, is located approximately 2,700 feet southeast of the property. The direction of groundwater flow in the area appears to be towards the south-southeast.    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP). The case meets all the general and media-specific criteria of the LTCP. Analyses for polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil are not required due to the absence of a waste oil UST at the site.  No soil samples collected from depths less than five feet below ground surface were analyzed for naphthalene but the maximum soil concentration of diesel found at the site in the vicinity of the “tire and oil shop”, an expected source area, was reported to be 1,900 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) at a depth of 11 feet below grade surface (bgs).  The LUFT manual indicates that naphthalene is present at an average of 0.26% and a maximum of 0.8% in fresh diesel product.  This indicates that naphthalene may be present at an average concentration up to 4.94 mg\/kg in this sample, which is below the Table 1 criteria for a residential or commercial facility.  ACEH has made the determination that there is low potential for direct contact exposure because of the current land use as a mixed commercial\/residential building and the entire site is paved.     Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, Alameda County Environmental health (ACEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.",

Soil vapor extraction began in June 1991 and groundwater remediation began in October 1991.  Remediation was suspended in 1992 apparently due to the responsible parties' financial problems.    Underground storage tanks and piping were removed from the site on August 9, 2011.  Additional investigation is currently planned for the site.

A more complete historic case file for this site may be located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at https:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The site is an active commercial fueling station.  The case was opened when a waste oil UST (WOT) was removed from the site in August 1996. One large hole was observed at the base of the WOT and other holes were observed on the sides and top of the tank.  Soil staining and odors were evident in the tank pit.  The WOT pit was over excavated and extended  to a depth of 10 feet (stopped at GW).  Confirmation sidewall samples, labeled  SA- through SA-4, were collected at about 7 to 7.5 feet.  Maximum reported concentrations were 180 mg\/kg TPHg and 2,400 mg\/kg TPHd, benzene and ethyl benzene non-detect.  Lead was reported at concentration of 61 mg\/kg with a STLC of 11 mg\/L.  Analysis of a GGW sample of pit infiltration water revealed 65 ug\/L TPHg and 3,700 ug\/L TPHd with BTEX was non detect.       Current case status includes submittal of a work plan for additional site characterization.  ACDEH has requested submittal of a revised figure depicting bore locations- due in April 2020.    Previously in April 1985, fuel USTs at the former Chevron Station were tested for tightness.  One tank failed the test.  Three groundwater monitoring wells were installed on April 19, 1985.  Free product was observed in well #1 to a maximum thickness of 0.61-foot.  The well MW-1 was destroyed during excavation activities on September 13, 1985 with a replacement well in the approximate same location as well #1.  The leaking tank, tank #2, was coated with epoxy, retested for tightness and returned to service.  A subsurface investigation was conducted; however the report was not submitted.        In August 1997, three additional fuel tanks consisting of one 4,000-gallon, one 8,000-gallon, one 9,000-gallon USTs were removed from the site.  Stained soil and localized floating product was observed in the tank pit.  Activities associated with the tank removals documented concentrations of up to 180 mg\/kg TPHg, 2,400 mg\/kg TPHd, 3,200 mg\/kg TOG, 6,700 mg\/kg TRPH, lead to 210 mg\/kg, and 490 mg\/kg zinc in site soil. Groundwater was report to contain TPHd at 3,700 ug\/L.  The tank pit was enlarged to accommodate a new 20,000-gallon UST, generating approximately 800 cu yds of soil.  ACDEH is not aware of additional work having been performed since 2002.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Parcel F2 is located at the southwest corner of Embarcadero West and Alice Street in Jack London Square. It was a paved parking lot before redevelopment begain in 2018. Environmental investigations have been performed at the Site between 1995 and 2014 to evaluate potential soil, soil gas, and groundwater contamination. Those investigations indicate the presence of petroleum compounds and heavy metals in soil and groundwater at concentrations slightly over environmental screening levels. In April 2015, soil with elevated concentrations of contaminants in one area of the Site was excavated and disposed of at an offsite permitted disposal facility.    Potential long-term exposures to Site contaminants will be avoided by “durable ground covers” including the building structure, paved parking areas, and landscaping. After completion of the ground-disturbing activities, the Site owner will submit an SMP implementation report.     Developer, CIM Group, began construction in 2018 and implemented the 2015 soil management plan (SMP) to manage contaminated soil and groundwater beneath the subject parcel. The redevelopment 8-story residential building constructed at grade consisting of three levels of concrete podium and five levels of wood  framing. The proposed building footprint will occupy the majority of the site footprint and will replace the existing asphalt cover and fill material with concrete foundations, paved surfaces, and clean fill.

At the time of discovery, the UST was filled with oily water and low viscosity petroleum hydrocarbons.  The approximately 500-gallon UST was removed from the site on May 20, 2014.  Multiple corrosion holes were observed in the middle and bottom of the UST.  The soil underneath the UST exhibited a strong petroleum odor.  Soil samples collected from the tank pit contained up to 1,100 parts per million (ppm) of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as diesel (TPHg) and 1,100 ppm TPH as bunker oil.  A groundwater sample collected from the tank pit contained 4,600 parts per billion (ppb) of TPH as diesel and 4,700 ppb as bunker oil.  Additional soil and groundwater sampling that was completed at the site in July and August 2014 indicated that the residual contamination was generally limited to the area of the former tank pit.    The site was evaluated for case closure under the State Water Resources Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy and was closed on November 25, 2014.  Based upon the information available in our files to date, no further investigation or cleanup for the fuel leak case is necessary at this time.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Current Site Land-Use:  The subject property (APN 34-2300-13-7) is located 4575 Tidewater Avenue, in the western portion of the City of Oakland adjacent to San Francisco Bay.  The 6.7 acre site, where the four underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed is situated between Tidewater Avenue and the water channel extending north from San Leandro Bay, separating the cities of Alameda and Oakland.  The site is used as a trucking terminal with a maintenance building located near the western property boundary.     Site Location and Local Geology\/Hydrogeolgy:  The site is located within the historic margins of the San Leandro Bay. Soil encountered during drilling at the site generally consists of 10 feet of fill underlain by tidal march deposits and Bay Mud. The static depth to groundwater based on data collected from borings and groundwater monitoring wells is between 3.2 and 5.6 feet bgs.     Environmental Site Cleanup Cases:  There are two environmental cases associated with this parcel. Closed Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Case No. RO0003033 was related to the investigation and cleanup of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination associated with releases from four former petroleum underground storage tanks (USTs). This Site Cleanup Case (SCP) Case No. RO0003134 is associated with the investigation of tetrachloroethene (PCE) that has been detected in soil vapor and product that was observed in a soil boring ( SB-4) in the vicinity of drains in the maintenance bays of the facility. A summary of site investigations and cleanup actions is presented below. Because one of the former petroleum USTs was a waste oil UST, data  generated during the LUST case investigations that is pertinent to the PCE site investigation is referenced below in the evaluation of risk of the PCE release.    Four USTs once operated to the east side of the maintenance shop site until the late 1980’s.  Between 1996 and 1997,  two waste oil USTs and one diesel or formerly gasoline UST and one diesel or formerly gasoline UST were removed from the site and two groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 and MW-2) installed to evaluated impacts to groundwater from releases from the tanks.     In 2012 two additional groundwater monitoring wells (MW-3 and MW-4), and twelve soil borings (B-1 through B-12) were installed to collect soil and groundwater samples to delineate the extent of petroleum hydrocarbon impacts at the site.    Between 2012 and 2013 two vapor pins (SVP-1 and SVP-2) were installed in the maintenance shop building slab sampled in June 2012, December 2012 and January 2012 to evaluate soil vapor concentrations beneath the building.  Soil vapor samples had PCE concentrations above the then current Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs; December 2013) promulgated by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board.      In 2014, this case (SCP Case No. RO31340) was opened to investigate the non-petroleum UST releases at the site.  In 2015, 10 passive soil vapor sampling probes (SG-1 through SG-10) and six soil bores (SB-1 through SB-8) were installed to investigate the extent of PCE impacts to soil, groundwater and soil vapor.  Four-inches of Light Non Aqueous Phased Liquids (LNAPL) was observed in one soil bore (SB-4) located near the location where PCE has been detected at elevated levels in soil vapor.      In 2015, two additional bores (SB-7 and SB-8) were installed to refine the extent of potential petroleum hydrocarbon LNAPL or dissolved-phase and PCE contamination in soil and groundwater.   Sewer lines and drain pipes were also partially cleared to perform a video survey to determine whether floor drains and sewer lines are potential sources of petroleum LNAPL detected at the site.  The drain pipes could not be entirely cleared due to obstructions in the pipes.    In February 2017, a third sub-slab vapor pin (SVP-3) was installed to define the lateral limit of PCE sub-slab vapor concentrations. All PCE (and daughter products) concentrations were below the revised (February 2016) commercial ESLs, including those previously collected during the vapor sampling events in 2012 and 2013.  Based on the investigations, the PCE vapor contamination appears to be localized to one or more floor drains in the maintenance shop, appears limited in extent, and thus appears associated with a limited maintenance shop operation. Therefore, in a letter dated May 15, 2017 ACDEH staff concluded that the PCE detected in soil vapor beneath the building did not present a significant vapor intrusion risk to occupants of the maintenance building (based on the 2016 ESLs) and was considering the case for closure contingent upon long-term management of the site to control exposure risk.     Subsequent to issuance of ACDEH's letter theESLs were revised in 2019. ACDEH has evaluated the PCE soil vapor concentrations against the commercial ESLs for vapor intrusion risk and while previously determined to be below the December 2013 and 2016 version of the ESL, are above the 2019 ESLs.     Remediation Activities:  Besides overexcavation of impacted soil in the UST pit during UST removals in 1987 no corrective actions have been performed at the site where petroleum hydrocarbons and PCE have been detected in the vicinity of the drains and sewer.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This project was formerly named '�Millennial Hotel Redevelopment Project' and was renamed 'Uptown Moxy' at meeting of July 23, 2018.      Site was formerly a Valero branded retail gasoline station- leaking underground fuel tank (LUFT) case (Case No. RO0000358)- located on the southwest corner of the intersection of West Grand Avenue and Telegraph Avenue in a mixed-use commercial \/ residential area of Oakland.  The station has been removed and a zero-lot-line hotel is currently being constructed.  The case was opened in November 2017 to address potential vapor intrusion concerns associated with residual contamination at the property.    The seven story modular-unit hotel is being developed for the site.  Due to the presence of residual petroleum hydrocarbon contamination, this site cleanup program (SCP) case was created to address the change in land use from that of an active fueling station to commercial (hotel).     Remediation, performed in conjunction with property redevelopment, will include removal of primary and secondary contaminant sources.  Additional residual source material will also be removed to the extent practicable.  Post remediation groundwater monitoring will be conducted using four perimeter wells transferred to this case from the existing LUFT case monitoring well network.  The on-site wells have been abandoned and project schedule is for station decommissioning with UST system removal, soil excavation, ISCO application and groundwater monitoring.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently developed as a 5-story hotel having a slab-on-grade foundation.  At the time this case was opened, the property was owned by Oakland Garden Hotel LLC.  The property, a former parking lot, had recently been transferred from the Redevelopment Agency of the City of Oakland following closure of the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) Spills, Leaks, Investigation and Cleanup (SLIC) Program case RO0002673, STID 5803 and GeoTracker Global ID T0601975838, for the subject site.  Residual petroleum hydrocarbon (PH) contamination was encountered along the sidewalk area along Ninth Street during excavation activities for the hotel foundation.  The residual PH concentrations exceeded the case closure concentrations reported for RO0002673, closed on April 13, 2000.   PH contaminated soil was excavated and the hotel constructed.  However, the case had not been closed.     ACDEH’s review of the case file determined the case met all General Criteria of the State Water Resources Control Board’s (SWRCBs) Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (LTCP) and two of the three Media Specific LTCP Criteria (Groundwater and Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Criteria).  It was unclear to ACDEH if the site met the LTCP Media Specific Criteria for Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air (VI-IA).  Therefore, in a letter dated May 20, 2016, ACDEH requested the collection and analysis of indoor air samples in order to satisfy the VI-IA criteria.  The findings of the vapor intrusion study, presented in a report dated June 8, 2016, demonstrated concentrations of PHs were below the laboratory reporting limits for the indoor air samples, thus satisfying the LTCP VI-IA Criteria.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0003417 was opened by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) in February 2020 to provide regulatory oversight of the investigation and cleanup of subsurface contamination at the Site to facilitate redevelopment by 1510 Webster Street GP LLC.     The Site is located in a mixed residential and commercial area of downtown Oakland and consists of two rectangular parcels (Alameda County Assessor Parcel Numbers (APN) 8-625-34-1 and 8-625-32 totaling approximately 0.33-acres located at the northeast corner of the intersection between Webster Street and 15th Street.  The current configuration of the Site includes a large Warehouse\/office building located at 1510 Webster St. (APN 8-625-34-1) and a smaller warehouse located at 344 15th Street (APN 8-625-32). Both buildings are currently unoccupied.  There is a one-level basement which is approximately 10 feet below existing street grade at the uilding located at 1510 Webster Street.     Conceptual redevelopment plans include the construction of a 3 to 4 story commercial\/office building with ground floor retail\/restaurants.  Future development may consists of residential units above the commercial\/office space.  The subterranean floor is also conceptually planned.     The Site is accessed via Webster Street to the west and 15th Street to the south and is bound to the north by a coffee roasters; to the east by a public parking lot and retail\/office spaces; to the south by office spaces and 15th Street, followed by a mixed-use office\/retail building; to the west by office buildings; and to the southwest by an office building across the intersection of Webster Street and 15th Street.      Review of available Sanborn Fire Maps identify the Site as consisting of dwellings from 1887 until at least 1911. An auto repair building was observed from around 1925 through 1943, as well as a restaurant from the 1930’s until 1943. In the early 1950s, the current larger building was built and occupied by offices through the 1980’s. A knitting company operated at the Site from approximately 1992 to 2015. The smaller parcel became a parking lot from at least 1950 through 1993. In 1995, the newer\/smaller building was built and occupied by various offices up to mid 2010s.           Subsurface investigations were conducted in May and June 2019 and included the collection of soil, grab-groundwater, soil gas, and sub-slab vapor samples to evaluate potential subsurface impacts and vapor intrusion concerns.  Soil and grab groundwater were collected from three borings (SB-1 through SB-3).  Soil samples were collected from 5 feet below the building floor slab and analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 8260B.  One sample was analyzed for Title 22 Metals. Grab groundwater collected from first encountered groundwater using temporary slotted PVC casing and analyzed for VOCs by EPA Method 8260B and gasoline-, diesel-, and motor-oil-range total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHg\/d\/mo) by EPA Method 8015.  Soil results indicate VOCs were detected including tetrachloroethene (PCE) and methyl- ethyl- ketone (MEK) with concentrations up to 0.00166 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) and 0.0404 mg\/kg, respectively.  Grab-groundwater was only collected from two locations and detected PCE concentrations up to  8.8 micrograms per liter (ug\/L).    Three temporary soil gas locations (SG-1 through SG-3) were advanced to a depth of 5 feet bgs and analyzed for VOCs including isopropyl alcohol (IPA) by EPA Method TO-15.   Analytical results indicated PCE at concentrations ranging from 21 to 230 micrograms per cubic meter (µg\/m3) were detected in the soil gas probes.  Additionally, benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene was also detected in the soil gas probes.    Five sub-slab vapor pins was advanced inside the building located at 1510 Webster Street only.  PCE, trichloroethene (TCE), and benzene were detected above  applicable regulatory environmental screening levels in all locations for residential and commercial land use.    Additional subsurface investigations in all media are warranted to evaluate data gaps, possible remediation of discovered VOCs, engineering controls (e.g., vapor intrusion mitigation system) and institutional controls (e.g., land use covenant). Prior to occupancy, indoor air sampling for PCE, TCE, and benzene would likely be required to evaluate potential vapor intrusion risk and to comply with regulatory residential screening levels.",

This case was open as a leaking underground fuel leak case in 1995 and was re-classified as a site cleanup program case in July 2006. The site has been used for industrial activities, including railroad, lumber yard, shipbuilding, machine shop and welding, chemical processing and shipping activities, since the early 1900s.    Thirteen USTs were removed from the site betwee1986 and 1995, including...    Four USTs, a 2,000-gallon gasoline, two 10,000-gallon diesel, and a 550-gallon WO, were removed in 1990.  Remediation activities included off-site bioremediation and the off-haul of approximately 334 cu yds of affected soil for disposal.  Four USTs, a 1,000-gallon gasoline, a 10,000-gallon  and 5,000-gallon diesel, and a 550-gallon WO, were removed in 1992.  Groundwater entering the tank pit was contained 1\/2-inch layer of free product. Limited over excavation was performed.  Concentrations in soil were reported to include up to 5,000 mg\/kg TPHg, 11,000 mg\/kg TPHd, 0.6 mg\/kg benzene, and 1.1 mg\/kg 1,2-DCE.  SVOCs were also reported n soil.  22,600 gallons of water was removed from the excavation prior to excavation backfill.  Grab groundwater samples were reported to include up to 1,400 ug\/L benzene, 940 ug\/L PCE, 2,100 ug\/L TCE 300 ug\/L vinyl chloride, 3,900 ug\/L methylene chloride, and 1,300 ug\/L acetone.  One 4,000-gallon Diesel UST removed in 1995.  Over excavation produced 144 cu yds disposed off site. Concentrations in soil were reported to include up to 2,600 mg\/kg TPHd.   Approximately 2,500 gallons of water pumped from the pit.  A grab groundwater sample contained 5,800 ug\/L TPHd.     In addition to the UST removals, activities of note include two fuel facilities, including the El Dorado Oil Works, were removed - one in 1972 and another in 1975 and the Sherex Chemical Company operated through 1986, in 1995 surface releases involving a ruptured PCB-containing transformer and a rail yard diesel spill occurred.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "• An environmental investigation was performed by H+GCL at the Site in 1992 in which a monitoring well (MW-1) was installed in front of the former General Tire at the request of a prospective buyer to evaluate environmental conditions at the Site; total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPH-d) and the chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) 1,1 dichloroethane, cis-1,2-dichloroethene, trans-1,2-dchloroethene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and trichloroethylene contamination in groundwater were reported as well as low levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in hydraulic reservoir oil and asbestos in floor tiles.   • Following the environmental investigation, ACDEH submitted a letter to General Tire, Inc. stating that the investigation results indicated no significant hazardous waste constituents were present, and no additional requirements were necessary at the time.   • A work plan dated June 4, 1993 for further investigative work at the Site including installation of two additional monitoring wells was submitted to ACDEH for review. ACDEH responded in a letter dated July 12, 1993 requesting additional analysis in the workplan.   • Separate site investigation reports dated February and October 1994 were submitted to ACDEH by Jonas &amp; Associates on behalf of General Tire. The investigations consisted of advancement of eight soil borings, and conversion of two soil borings to groundwater monitoring wells, and associated soil and groundwater sampling and analysis. The results indicated the CVOCs tetrachloroethene (PCE), TCE and their degradation products were detected in soil at the locations of monitoring well MW-2 and nearby soil borings, adjacent to the former Style Cleaners; PCE degradation products were detected in soil at lower concentrations downgradient of the former Style Cleaners; groundwater sampling results were consistent with the soil boring results in that PCE, TCE and degradation products were detected in MW-2, and lower concentrations of PCE degradation products were detected at MW-1. Groundwater sampling results indicated PCE, TCE and degradation products were detected in the monitoring well MW-2 at the adjacent Style Cleaners Site, a former dry cleaner; lower concentrations of CVOCs excluding PCE and TCE were detected at MW-1, in the front of the General Tire Building and downgradient from the dry cleaner. On this basis, Jonas &amp; Associates requested ACDEH relieve General Tire of any further environmental site investigations.  • In a Directive letter dated August 21, 1996 ACDEH stated that groundwater results from the General Tire investigations indicated the source of the CVOCs in groundwater were likely from upgradient, however, because CVOCs had been detected in soil on the Site, ACDEH would require ongoing groundwater monitoring.   • A risk-based model dated November 14, 1997 was provided to ACDEH for the General Tire Site, which evaluated the potential for human health risk from vapor intrusion to indoor and outdoor air as a result of the presence of chlorinated solvents in groundwater. The risk-based model indicates that carcinogenic risk was below 1 x 10-5. In correspondence dated March 3, 1998, ACDEH stated that based on the information presented in the risk-based corrective action model, the Site did not pose a threat to public health, and that no further action was required at the General Tire Site.   • In June 1998, General Tire provided a work plan to ACDEH for removal of six hydraulic hoists located on the General Tire Site. An addendum dated August 10, 1998 indicated that samples would be collected, including groundwater samples in the event groundwater was encountered during hoist removal.   • The hydraulic hoist removal was documented in a report dated October 16, 1998 which presented results of soil and water sampling and analysis. The results indicated that PCE was detected in one soil sample at eight feet below ground surface from beneath a hydraulic reservoir at 14 micrograms per kilogram;the report also presented soil, water and groundwater samples with elevated petroleum hydrocarbons.   • In November 1998, General Tire presented ACDEH with work plans to perform additional excavation, remove water present in the excavation pits, and install an additional monitoring well. The additional excavation activities were performed and reported to ACDEH in a site remediation report dated December 23, 1998 which reported the removal of 17,000 gallons of groundwater, over-excavation of soil previously impacted with elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons and installation and sampling of the monitoring well which had reported concentrations of CVOCs in groundwater. Additionally, the report included the results of post-pumping groundwater result following removal of groundwater from the former hydraulic-lift basins; basin B1 reported post-groundwater pumping results that indicated PCE, TCE and cis-1,2 DCE were detected in groundwater following pumping of groundwater from the former hydraulic lift basins.   • Subsequent groundwater monitoring reports for the General Tire Site through the year 2000 confirmed that CVOCs were consistently detected in groundwater, with very low to non-detectable levels of petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater as diesel, motor oil and kerosene and the greatest detections of PCE and TCE at well MW-2, adjacent to the former Style Cleaners.  In correspondence dated May 11, 2001 ACDEH requested concurrence from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board  for no further action with respect to petroleum hydrocarbons or VOCs at the Site, as it “is believed that the VOCs are from a dry cleaners located immediately upgradient of the site”.  ACDEH’s review of the case file indicates the monitoring wells are likely to remain on the Site and have not been sampled since the year 2000.     This site remains an open case requiring further evaluation.",

There have been no service station operations since 1960, and the dry cleaning operations ceased in 2012, and the buidling is vacant. Soil and groundwater investigations occurred bewteen 2005 and 2009. A 2011 Corrective Action Plan reported that PCE releases likely occurred at or near the northeast corner of the building in the vicinity of the dry cleaning machine and migrated in groundwater accross the site in groundwater.  Gasoline related compounds were also detected in soil and groundwater, most likely related to past service station operations at the site in the northwest corner ot the property. Groundwater depths ranges from 10 to 17 feet below grade and the calculated flow direction has been consistently to the southwest. Soil vapor pilot testing began in November 2013 to evauate the feasibility of the technology. The SVE operated as interim remedial action for six months (December 2014 to June 2014).  The SVE has operated as a final remedial action since July 2014.  Groundwater monitoring shows decreasing concentrations trends of  PCE and TPH as gasoline, based on the data from Wells MW-1 through MW-4.  As of December 2014, the maximum PCE concentrations are 38 ppb in the source well MW-1 and the downgradient well MW-4, and the maximum TPH-g concentrations are 100 ppb in MW-3 and 67 in MW-4, which are both located downgradient from the former service station. A remediation progress report on the efficiency of the SVE system will be submitted in August 2015.",

To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as automobile service and repair operations with associated former underground storage tanks, and painting and machine shops.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil, soil vapor, and groundwater).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include the hazardous material survey and abatement of the existing onsite building and hardscape; demolition of existing Site buildings and above ground infrastructure; remediation and\/or off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; extraction, treatment, and discharge of groundwater to the sanitary sewer; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes a 12-story L-shaped, mid-rise residential tower with residential dwelling units above a 4-story garage with a combination of residential units and retail on the ground floor.  Redevelopment will include the demolishment of the existing commercial and residential properties and excavation of soil to about 10 feet below ground surface for construction of a mat slab foundation.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is located in a mixed-use area of downtown Oakland and is currently developed as a 7,500 square foot building formerly doing business as Aqua Skin Care &amp; Day Spa.  Paved parking areas are located to the west and northeast of the Site building.  The eastern and southern property lines are bound by 12th street and Alice Street, respectively.  Historical records indicate that the Site was occupied by residential dwellings from 1889 to 1911 and from 1939 to 1974 by two different gas stations.  From 1980 onwards the Site has been occupied with the present-day structure and two adjacent parking lots.  Review of historical Sanborn Maps and aerial photographs indicate the former service stations included multiple fueling configurations.     Results of recognized environmental conditions identified in the Phase I were further investigated as part of the Phase II subsurface investigation conducted at the Site without regulatory oversight during November and December 2017.  Five borings and six sub-slab vapor pins were advanced for the collection of soil, soil vapor, sub-slab vapor, and groundwater samples.  Data from the Phase II investigations indicate that total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPH-g) was detected in soil located in the southern corner of the Site building.  Grab groundwater samples collected from five borings reported detections of TPHg, TPH as diesel (TPH-d), and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including chloroform, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,1 dichloroethene, 1,2-dichloropropane, trans-1,2-dichloroethene, tetrachloroethene (PCE), 1,1,1 trichloroethane, and styrene.    A potential new tenant is proposing to redevelop the Site into a Day Care Center which would include remodeling of the existing building and installation of new subsurface utilities and construction of a proposed outdoor play area in the western parking lot. The potential tenant will be conducting site investigations activities under agree with the property owner in order to evaluate potential human risk to occupants of the proposed Day Care Center.    In July 2018 an additional subsurface investigation was conducted at the site and included the advancement of 12 indoor sub-slab vapor pins and 3 outdoor soil vapor probes.  The sub-slab vapor pin locations were advanced in a 25-foot by 25-foot grid across the entire building footprint and generally located over or near former gas station subsurface infrastructure.  Three soil vapor probes were advanced in the western parking area to evaluate subsurface vapor in this area.  All sub-slab vapor and soil vapor samples were analyzed for TPH-g, VOCs, and fixed gases by EPA Method TO-15. Results from sub-slab vapor pins (SS-6 through SS-17) indicate total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPH-g) was detected in all sub-slab pins at concentrations up to 890 micrograms per cubic meter (µg\/m3).  Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were also reported in sub-slab samples including acetone, 2 butanone, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, isopropyl alcohol, xylenes, and tetrachloroethene (PCE).  Soil gas probes (SVP 1 through SVP-9), collected in the area of the proposed outdoor play area, reported TPH-g concentrations in all soil vapor probes with a maximum reported concentration of 770 µg\/m3.  Soil and soil vapor samples collected at a depth of five foot below ground surface (bgs) or greater beneath the onsite building and adjacent vicinity indicate TPH concentrations remain low.  Oxygen results reported from the sub-slab and soil vapor probes installed at the 5-foot bgs interval indicate the presence of a bioattenation zone.    Investigation results indicate media-specific criteria for vapor intrusion to indoor air criteria is considered low risk under the State Water Resources Control Board's Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (LTCP) under the current building configuration and outdoor air exposure in the proposed play area from residual contamination in the subsurface from historic use as a commercial fueling station.  A soil and groundwater management plan (SGMP) was prepared to describe procedures to be followed by environmental consultants, construction contractors and workers, and other property owner representatives during any proposed property improvements.  Furthermore, tenant improvements include the installation of new subsurface utilities, potentially affecting preferential pathway contaminant vapor migration from subsurface to indoor air, therefore, additional sub-slab vapor and indoor air samples will be collected post utility installation to insure vapor migration to indoor air is not a completed pathway.    Case files also indicate additional soil and groundwater investigations are warranted to address LTCP General Criteria e (site conceptual model) , f (secondary source), and media specific criteria for groundwater.",

The underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed from the property and perimeter sidewalks in 2007 along with the hydraulic lift and fluid reservoir from the former repair garage. In 2003, the City of Oakland Environmental Services Division (OESD) required the site be investigated in preparation of a City-sponsored redevelopment loan to Community Development Corporation of Oakland to construct low-income housing units at the empty lot.     Soil and groundwater sampling identified total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline, total oil &amp; grease, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BTEX), lead as chemical contaminants. Over 600 cubic yards of impacted soil was excavated and disposed offsite. All the excavations were backfilled with clean imported soil to pre-existing grade. Impacted groundwater was treated by hydrogen peroxide treatments in June, July, August, September, October, November 2009 and March 2010 added to wells MW-2, GWT-1, GWT-3.    Subsurface soil at the site consists of a black to dusky brown, lean clay from the surface to approximately 3 to 6 feet below ground surface (bgs). Soils beneath this depth are highly variable with various combinations of clay, silt, sand, gravel. Groundwater was first encountered between depths of approximately 14 and 16 feet bgs. The direction of groundwater flow was determined to be to the east-southeast.     The site is eligible for low threat case closure, based on sampling data from soil, soil vapor and groundwater Investigations, primary and secondary source removal actions and post remedial monitoring data.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is occupied by Cruise America, which is a recreational vehicle rental facility.    Two buildings exist on site and are surrounded by paved parking areas.  Nearby properties are also commercial properties.  Prior to Cruise America acquiring the site in August 1988, the site was occupied from 1957 to 1988 by McGuire Hester, a construction company.  The site was reportedly was used as a slaughter and meat packing facility prior to 1956.    Three underground storage tanks were removed from three separate tank pits in January 1987.  T1 was a 1,000-gallon gasoline tank; T2 was a 5,000-gallon gasoline tank, and T3 was an 8,000-gallon diesel tank.  Petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) were detected in soil samples collected beneath T1 and T2 at concentrations up to 758 ppm.  TPH as diesel (TPHd) was detected in soil samples collected beneath T3 at concentrations up to 492 ppm.  Standing water in the tank pits had a visible hydrocarbon sheen and product odor.      One monitoring well was installed adjacent to each former tank in January 1987 (AGS-MW-1, AGS-MW-2, and AGS-MW-3).  TPHd was detected in soil samples from AGS-MW-3, which was adjacent to the diesel tank, at concentrations up to 1,750 ppm.  Soil samples collected from borings AGS-MW-1 and AGS-MW0-2 near the gasoline tanks contained minor concentrations of TPHg and BTEX.      On February 17, 1988, Purcell, Rhoades, &amp; Associates advanced three shallow borings and installed three temporary monitoring wells (B-4 through B-6 and PRA-MW-1 through PRA-MW-3).  TPHg and TPHd were detected in soil at concentrations up to 270 and 74, ppm, respectively.  Oil &amp; Grease was detected in a soil sample from boring B-4 at a concentration of 32,000 ppm.    Between May 25, 1988 and July 27, 1988, a total of 15 soil borings were advanced as part of a geotechnical investigation for construction of the Cruise America facility.  A petroleum odor was noticed in several of the geotechnical borings.    During the construction activities in 1988, contamination was observed in the area of the gasoline UST (presumed to be T4) and the existing waste oil tank currently located adjacent to the Repair Building.  Remediation of these areas was recommended by Kaldveer Associates, the environmental consultant for the site in 1989; however, there is no documentation to indicate that remediation of these areas took place during the construction activities.  Cleanup of the T4 area took place between 2002 and 2009.  Although no cleanup has been conducted adjacent to the existing waste oil tank, one soil boring (SB-21) was advanced adjacent to the waste oil tank in 2009.   TPHd and TPHmo were detected in soil from SB-21 at concentrations up to 180 ppm and 110 ppm, respectively.  Based on the results from boring SB-21, the extent of contamination appears to be limited in the area of the waste oil tank.    On July 11, 1988, eleven soil borings (B20 through B30) were advanced in the area surrounding the diesel tank pit.  High boiling point hydrocarbons were detected in soil samples from the shallow borings at concentrations up to 42 ppm.  As part of the July 1988 investigation, groundwater samples were collected from wells PRA-MW-1, PRA-M-2, and AGS-MW-3.  High boiling point hydrocarbons were detected in groundwater at concentrations ranging from 720 to 60,000 ppb.     Between July 28, 1988 and August 1, 1988, the former diesel tank (T3) pit area was excavated to a depth of 15 feet bgs.  Soil with visible staining or odor outside the diesel tank pit was reportedly excavated to a depth of 5 feet bgs.  Seven soil samples were collected from the base and sidewalls of the excavation (S-1 through S-7) following the initial excavation.  Based on sample analytical results from samples, S-2 and S-4, the excavation was continued and three additional soil samples were collected on August 1, 1988 (S-8 through S-10).  During the excavation, buried timbers with creosote were observed.  The area of the diesel tank was backfilled with clean, imported fill.  Following the exploratory excavation, an additional monitoring well, PRA-MW-4, was installed adjacent to the excavation area.  Groundwater from PRA-MW-4 contained TPHd at a concentration of 2,300 ppb.    On October 17, 1988, composite soil samples were collected from the stockpiled soil from the excavation.  The stockpiled soil remained on site awaiting treatment or disposal.  On November 1, 1998, a Notice of Violation was issued as a result of a site inspection by ACEH.  Additional soil samples were collected from the soil stockpile on November 21, 1998 prior to off-site disposal.    In July 2001, six soil borings (SB-1 through SB-6) were advanced in the area of the former gasoline tanks (T1 and T2) and the former diesel tank (T3) to assess whether residual soil or groundwater contamination remained from the former USTs that were removed in 1988.  TPHg and TPHd were detected at low concentrations in groundwater but MTBE was detected at an elevated concentration of 650 ppb in a grab groundwater sample from boring SB-1.      In September 2001, an additional five soil borings were advanced (SB-7 through SB11) in order to find the source of high levels of MTBE found in SB-1.  A groundwater sample collected from SB-7 did not contain MTBE at concentrations above reporting limits.  MTBE concentrations varied from 630 ppb in SB-9 to 13,000 ppb in SB-10.  Based on these data, a leak in the remaining 10,000-gallon UST on the southern portion of the property (T4) was interpreted to be the most likely source of MTBE.      On November 30, 2001, the 10,000-gallon gasoline tank (T4) was removed.  Soil samples collected from the tank pit and dispenser area contained TPHg at concentrations up to 280 ppm.  Benzene and MTBE were detected at concentrations up to 53 and 13 ppm, respectively along the southern and eastern sidewalls of the excavation at a depth of approximately 6.5 feet bgs.  TPHg and MTBE were detected in a groundwater sample from the tank pit excavation at 44,000 ppb and 42,000 ppb, respectively.      In response to the contamination observed during removal of the gasoline tank (T4), a fuel leak case was opened by ACEH on May 21, 2002 and an Unauthorized Release Form was submitted on May 29, 2002.  No case closure or other documentation was located for the investigation and excavation conducted prior to 2001.   Therefore, this case closure also evaluates the results from the investigation and excavation conducted in 1987 and 1988 for the tanks T1 through T3.    On September 6, 2002, six soil borings (SB-12 through SB-17) were advanced at the site.  Data from the soil borings were used to locate five monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-5), which were installed on September 19, 2002.  Groundwater monitoring was conducted at the site from 2002 to 2008.    A twelve-point ozone sparging system was installed around the area of the 10,000-gallon gasoline tank (T4) between May and July 2004.  The sparging system operated through July 2006.  The ozone sparging system remained off for several months to monitor possible rebound.  In July 2008, five soil borings (SB-18 through SB-22) were advanced to confirm the effectiveness of the ozone sparging in reducing contaminant mass in the area of the former gasoline tank (T4).  Significant concentrations of TPHg, MTBE, and TBA were detected in a groundwater sample from boring B-18.  Based on the elevated concentrations of chemicals of concern detected in soil and groundwater from SB-18, excavation was recommended in the localized area of boring SB-18.      On February 12, 2009, the soil around borings SB-13 and SB-18 were excavated to a depth of 6.5 feet bgs. Following receipt of analytical results, which showed TPHg in soil at a concentration of 160 ppm, the excavation was extended several feet northwest.  During the excavation, a debris layer consisting of trash, wood, cardboard, and black-stained soil was observed in the lower part of the excavation.  The debris and stained soil appears to have been emplaced with the fill material that was used to fill in low-lying wetlands areas at the site sometime prior to 1956.  The source and content of the debris and black-stained fill material has not been evaluated as part of this fuel leak case.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is an active Valero branded gasoline service station located at the northwest corner of Bancroft Avenue and 73rd Avenue in Oakland. The station’s current configuration, unchanged since approximately 1987, consists of three 10,000-gallon underground storage tanks, five dispenser islands, a facility station building, and a separate building that includes restrooms and storage. Surrounding land use is mixed residential and commercial. Eastmont Mall and a former Union 76 service station are located across Bancroft Avenue to the east.    This Site has been an open environmental case since 1996. Assessment efforts have included the installation of 12 monitoring wells, four soil vapor probes, and 12 soil borings to provide lateral and vertical characterization of constituent of concern impacts. Groundwater monitoring and sampling has been ongoing since 1998. Onsite soil vapor probes were installed in 2005 along the northwestern site boundary to evaluate vapor pathways to the adjacent residential property. LNAPL has been observed at the Site, most recently in November, 2020, up to 0.15 foot.    Remediation efforts have included soil excavation during the 1996 product piping removal and replacement, surfactant injection in wells MW-1 and MW-7 in 2007 followed by extraction of surfactant-groundwater-light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) from well MW- 1, and a LNAPL recovery via a hydrocarbon absorbent sock since 2017 in well MW-1. The Site is currently being evaluated for remedial action to reduce contaminants of concern in groundwater and soil vapor.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "ACEH has determined that the one remaining data gap has been addressed and is considering the case for closure.  The data gap, the lack of lateral plume delineation, was addressed when the updated sensitive receptor survey did not identify any wells within 2,000 feet of the site.    ACEH concured that the well sampling could be suspended until a determination is made.    The site is located  in a mixed residential and commercial area on the south corner of the intersection of International Boulevard (formerly East 14th Street) and 64th Avenue in Oakland, California. The Site is currently being used as a storage lot for used cars for an adjacent operating lot. Previously, a liquor store was operated onsite and the building from this operation is still present.  The site is predominantly covered with asphalt and concrete.     A gas station operated on the property since at least 1935.  In 1947, Richfield Oil Company purchased the property for the construction of a service station with completion taking place in 1949. The service station was operated by various Richfield Oil Company dealers from 1949 until at least 1971. In 1966 two 4,000 gallon and one 6,000 gallon replacement underground storage tanks (USTs) were installed on the property. Richfield Oil Company sold the property in 1971 to the Nattrass Corporation. The fueling station features including the USTs and dispensers were removed in 1976.    In May 2007, a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment was conducted. In April 2008, a Limited Phase II Environmental Site investigation was conducted and included the advancement of six soil borings (SB-1 through SB-6) down to 31 feet below ground surface (ft bgs). Soil samples were collected from each boring and ground-water samples were collected from borings SB-1, SB-2, SB-3 and SB-5. Soil boring SB-1 was drilled on the backside of the property to assess the potential for off-site contaminant migration. Borings SB-2, SB-3, SB-5 and SB-6 were advanced in the area suspected of containing the former USTs. SB-4 was advanced to assess a former pump island.    Soil samples from borings SB-1 through SB-6 contained Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons in the Gasoline Range (TPH-G) at concentrations up to 95 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) (SB-6 at 14 ft bgs), Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons in the Diesel Range (TPH-D) at concentrations up to 20 mg\/kg (SB-2 at 20 ft bgs), and Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons in the Motor Oil Range (TPHMO) at concentrations up to 51 mg\/kg (SB-2 at 20 ft bgs). Ground-water samples from borings  SB-1, SB-2, SB-3 and SB-5 contained TPH-G at concentrations up to 8.1 milligrams per liter (mg\/L) (SB-3), TPH-D at concentrations up to 7.2 mg\/L (SB-3), and TPH-MO at concentrations up to 0.18 mg\/L (SB-5). No concentrations of Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, or Xylenes (BTEX) were detected above the laboratory reporting limits in the soil or ground-water samples collected (GEOCON, 5\/7\/2008).    The Site elevation is approximately 24 feet above mean sea level. According to soil boring logs from the Phase II investigation, soils encountered at the Site consist primarily of sandy and silty clay from near ground surface to the total depth of 31 ft bgs at boring SB-6. Clayey gravel was encountered in borings SB-1 through SB-3 and SB-6 at depths ranging from six to twelve ft bgs, and in boring SB-1 and SB-2 at depths of 14 to 15 ft bgs. Some gravely sand was also  observed in boring SB-3 from 12 to 16 ft bgs, in boring SB-4 from five to eight ft bgs, SB-5 from 14 to 16 ft bgs, and boring SB-6 from 7.5 to nine ft bgs. In soil boring SB-5, 10 feet of fill was observed. Due to the presence of the fill, SB-5 is within the assumed location of a former UST(s), since removed. Ground water was initially encountered during Phase II drilling activities at approximately 21 ft bgs and rose to stabilize at approximately 9 ft bgs within the borings.     In July 2009, an additional on-site soil and groundwater investigation was conducted to assess the extent and\/or significance of soil and ground-water contamination at the Site, and included the installation of three groundwater monitoring wells to establish trends in groundwater elevatons, flow directons, horizontal gradients, and contaminant concentrations. Soil boring MW-1 (completed as well MW-1) was located approximately five feet southwest of the sidewalk on International Boulevard and centered in the concrete area in front of the building. Assuming a ground-water flow direction towards the southwest, boring MW-1 is upgradient and located northeast of SB-4 and the former fuel dispenser island. Soil boring MW-2 (completed as well MW-2) was located approximately 10 feet in from the sidewalk on 64th Avenue and from the back of the property, southwest of SB-5 and the assumed location of the former USTs. Soil boring MW-3 (completed as well MW-3) was located in the south corner of the property approximately 20 feet in from the back of the property and former store. The tested analytes were not detected above their respective reporting limits in the 20 soil samples collected for laboratory analysis with the exception of one sample containing GRO, which was detected at a concentration of 0.87 mg\/kg in boring MW-1 at 14.5 ft bgs.    Groundwater monitoring has been conducted on a quarterly basis starting in the 3rd Quarter 2009 through the 3rd Quarter 2010, at which time the frequency was reduced to semi-annually.     In November 2011, ARCO submitted a Request for Case Closure (RFC). The RFC was subsequently retracted after a meeting in August 2012 with ACEH and ARCO to discuss data quality issues. A Site Model and Case Closure Request was submitted on June 19, 2013. A review of the document reveals the same data quality issues noted in the previous RFC. Additonally, the SCM is filled with errors, makes conclusions that are not supported by data, and does not address potential source areas. The SCM was revised and reissued on October 8, 2013.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is the location of a Greyhound bus terminal that contains a diesel fueling facility. An unauthorized release was reported in June 1989 following Site investigation, and six diesel USTs were removed in April 1990. Approximately 714 tons of impacted soil were excavated from the UST pit area and disposed offsite in March 1991. Groundwater extraction and free product recovery were performed from January 1992 to January 1997, removing approximately 1,015 gallons of free product and groundwater mixture that was disposed offsite. In addition, approximately 82,610 gallons of contaminated groundwater were removed, treated and discharged to sanitary sewer. Active remediation has not been conducted at the Site since January 1997. Since 1992, 14 groundwater monitoring wells have been installed and 12 of them regularly monitored. The Site has recently been evaluated for additional remedial action utilizing injection and recovery of surfactant solution.     Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.

In July 1989 one 10,000-gallon and one 12,000-gallon gasoline USTs removed and replaced.  One 550-gallon waste-oil UST was also removed.   Soil samples were collected from 450 yd3 of stockpiled soil that were present at the site.  September 6 and 7, 1989 four monitoring wells were installed on-site.  In September 1998, two 12,000-gallon gasoline USTs and associated dispensers and product piping were removed from the site.  Soil samples collected indicated petroleum hydrocarbon impact.  Groundwater was not encountered during the tank removal.      Groundwater samples collected from the March 2006 borings had maximum detected concentrations of 13,000 ppb TPHg, 510 ppb benzene and 340 ppb MTBE.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This site is next to the Oakland Estuary in Oakland and is currently occupied by residential townhomes. From 1925 to 1980, Shell Oil owned and operated a bulk fuel distribution terminal at the site. Simmons Terminal Corporation purchased the property and continued these operations from 1980 to 1985. From 1985 to 2003, the site was used for heavy equipment and salvaged building material storage. In June 2003, Signature at the Estuary, LLC, purchased the property and began development of the current 100-unit residential townhouse complex. As part of its development work, Signature removed remaining infrastructure related to the fuel terminal, excavated and disposed of contaminated soil, and implemented groundwater cleanup by injecting an oxygen-releasing compound into the main excavation and a grid of injection wells.    Investigations conducted as early as 1982 have identified petroleum-related contamination in groundwater beneath the site, including floating product on the groundwater surface. The main chemicals identified include total petroleum hydrocarbons (as gasoline and diesel) and benzene. In 2004, the Board adopted the final Site Cleanup Requirements Order R2-2004-0046, which named Signature at the Estuary, LLC, as the discharger because it owned the property at the time and planned to redevelop the property. While most cleanup tasks have been completed, two issues remain: potential for vapor intrusion into the townhomes and a small petroleum sheen at one shoreline location. In 2010, Signature at the Estuary, LLC, informed Board staff it did not have the financial capacity to fulfill the remaining obligations under the Order. Shell Oil and Signature Properties, Inc. were added as responsible parties in an amendment of the Order R2-2011-0038.    An impermeable barrier was constructed by Signature in 2004 and included a geomembrane with an overlying riprap revetment along an area of the shoreline where petroleum hydrocarbon sheens and odors have been reported. A new geomembrane was installed in 2012, which that overlaps the original existing by approximately 5 feet and extends it approximately 50 feet to the west. Odors are still being reported at the property, and installation of a new permeable reactive barrier has been proposed and accepted by the Water Board.    Investigations are currently being conducted to determine the vapor intrusion risk into the townhomes.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is an active service station in a mixed commercial and residential area.  Chevron has operated a service station since approximately 1936.  Chevron’s records indicate that site improvements were made prior to 1936, indicating station operations prior to Chevron’s occupation of the site.  The site was remodeled in 1960 and included a new station building, two service bays, four 10,000-gallon fuel USTs one 1,000-gallon waste oil UST and two dispenser islands.  The site was remodeled again in 1996 with the removal of existing fuel USTs and the installation of three 10,000-gallon USTs, three dispenser islands, and two service bays.    In March 1991 wells C-1 to C-4 were installed.  Well C-1 at a depth of 3.5 to 5 feet bgs contained the maximum detected concentrations.  TOG was detected at 710 mg\/kg, TPHd at 410 mg\/kg, TPHg at 433 mg\/kg, benzene, at 2 mg\/kg, toluene at 16 mg\/kg, ethylbenzene at 5 mg\/kg, and total xylenes at 38 mg\/kg.  In August 1992 a 1,000-gallon waste oil UST was removed and replaced, while a 550-gallon waste oil UST was discovered adjacent to the 1,000-gallon UST.  The 550-gallon UST was additionally removed in October 1992.  Approximately 254 cubic yards of soil were excavated from the enlarged excavations and exported offsite to three landfills.  Well C-1 was destroyed during the October 1992 excavations.    In May and June 1996 the station was remodeled as described above.  Concentrations up to 1,100 mg\/kg TPHg, 1,200 mg\/kg TPHd, 16 mg\/kg benzene, 14 mg\/kg toluene, 19 mg\/kg ethylbenzene, and 22 mg\/kg total xylenes were detected, some of which remain in place onsite.  Due to elevated concentrations the UST excavations was expanded and ultimately approximately 775 cubic yards of soil were removed during the excavation and subsequent overexcavation.  The excavation bottom ranged between 5 and 17.5 feet in depth.  The excavation was dewatered and treated onsite, and discharged under permit to the EBMUD sanitary sewer.  Approximately 35,000 gallons of treated water was discharged.    Between 2001 and 2004 ORC socks were installed in wells C-2 and C-4.    In October and November 2005, and again in April 2006 nine soil bores were installed to define the lateral extent of hydrocarbons in groundwater.  SB-5 to SB-7 were installed in October 2005, SB-1 to SB-4 were installed in November 2005, and GP-1 to GP-4 were installed in April 2006.  TPHd, TPHg, BTEX, and MTBE were not detected in soil.  Except bore SB-5 grab groundwater in all bores contained detectable concentrations of TPHd (up to 2,800 µg\/l in GP-4) in groundwater.  In grab groundwater, TPHg was only present in GP-1 at 110 µg\/l, toluene was present up to 1.3 µg\/l, and total xylenes was only present in GP-1 at 0.52 µg\/l.  Benzene and ethylbenzene were not detected in the grab groundwater samples.  MTBE was only present in grab groundwater from bore SB-7 at a concentration of 4 µg\/l.    During the most recent groundwater sampling event (March 4, 2011) only MTBE was present in wells C-2 and C-3 (80 and 3 µg\/l, respectively).  Well C-4 contained 2,500 µg\/l TPHg, 1,500 µg\/l TPHd, 270 µg\/l benzene, 7 µg\/l toluene, 3 µg\/l ethylbenzene, 3 µg\/l total xylenes, and 250 µg\/l MTBE.  A public participation notice was mailed to local property owners and tenants in late July 2011; no responses were received.  The RWQCB concurred with closure and a well destruction request was issued   Site wells were destroyed on September 16, 2011.",

The indoor air and sub-slab vapor sampling results do not appear to indicate a risk for the current commercial building at the site.  A Site Management Plan (SMP) dated March 15, 2015 was approved by Alameda County Environmental Health (ACEH) for the site.  The Site Management Plan requires ACEH approval prior to any subsurface redevelopment.  ACEH must review and approve any plans for excavation or disturbance of the floor slab.  Closure of the case is under consideration following completion of a Covenant and Environmental Restriction on Property to manage potential future risks if the building or land use changes.    A fuel leak case (RO3015; Global ID T0600100337) was investigated for an adjacent parcel at 4265 International Boulevard.  The fuel leak case was closed in 1993.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Two former underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed from the site in 1986, however ACDEH does not have documentation of sampling from the UST removal. On June 3, 2006, three soil borings were drilled by Pangea at the site to determine the extent of soil and groundwater impact.  Up to 3,000 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), 850 mg\/kg TPH diesel (TPHd), 22 mg\/kg ethylbenzene, and 10 mg\/kg naphthalene were detected in soil samples.  Up to 1,700 micrograms per liter (ug\/l) TPHg, 1,000 ug\/l TPHd, 1,200 ug\/l TPH motor oil (TPH mo), 14 ug\/l benzene, 130 ug\/l ethylbenzene, and 16 ug\/l naphthalene were detected in groundwater.    Three groundwater monitoring wells (MW-101, MW-102, and MW-103), three direct push bores (DP-1, DP-2, and DP-3), and seven soil borings (B1 through B-7) were installed December 2015.  In March 2017 soil and grab groundwater samples were collected from 17 soil borings both on and off-site.  The three wells were monitored and sampled six times between December 2015 and July 2017. TPHg detections ranged between 14,000 ug\/L to 18,000 ug\/L and benzene detections ranged between 860 ug\/L to 1,000 ug\/L in MW-101. Sheen was observed in monitoring well MW-101 in July 2017 corresponding to an increase in TPHmo concentration. Historic data for TPHmo in this well was less than 250 ug\/L and then increased to 5,200 ug\/L in July 2017. The sheen noted in well MW 101 appears to be related to non-UST releases however observations of free product and sheen will continue to be conducted during semi-annual monitoring events and will also be investigated under a separate Site Cleanup Program Case.    The case was accepted into the Expedited Claim Account Program (ECAP) in June 2018.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    At the time of closure of LUST Case No. RO0000138; T0600102248 the site was occupied by a one story commercial building which was being used as an urgent care clinic and associated parking.    Land use near the site consisted of a mixture of commercial and residential properties.  The site is bounded on the northwest by Piedmont Avenue, to the northeast by a commercial building, to the southeast by residences, and on the southwest by Montell Street.    Site investigation activities were conducted between 1993 and 2018 to investigate petroleum hydrocarbon impacts to soil, groundwater, and sub-slab and crawl space vapor.    In October 1993, Environmental Science &amp; Engineering, Inc (ESE) oversaw the advancement of eight on-site soil borings (FNBO-1 through FNBO-8) to total depths ranging from 7.5 to 16.5 feet below ground surface (bgs).  A total of 11 soil samples were collected from the borings at depths ranging from 6 to 11 feet bgs.  Soil samples were analyzed for TPHg, TPHd, and BTEX.  In July 1998, Gettler-Ryan Inc. installed two onsite monitoring wells (MW-1 and MW-2) and two offsite monitoring wells (MW-3 and MW-4) to further evaluate soil and groundwater quality associated with the unauthorized release that occurred at the site.  Soil and groundwater were analyzed for TPHg, BTEX compounds, and MTBE.    In July 2008, CRA oversaw advancement of offsite exploratory soil boring SB-2 to further evaluate downgradient soil and groundwater quality.  Soil and groundwater was analyzed for TPHg, BTEX, MTBE, Di-isopropyl ether (DIPE), Ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE), Tertiary-amyl methyl ether (TAME), Tertiary-butyl alcohol (TBA), 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), and 1,2-dibromoethane (1,2-DBA).    In 2016 and 2017, offsite crawl space air samples (CS-1 and OA-1) were collected downgradient of the site at 3891 Piedmont Avenue within the estimated average plume length of 198 feet.  These samples were analyzed for TPHd, naphthalene, TPHg, and BTEX.  In April 2017, Stantec attempted the advancement of five soil borings (B-1 through B-5), but only successfully installed bores B-2, B-4 and B-5 due to obstructions in the subsurface, and installed and sampled four sub-slab vapor probes (SS-1 through SS-4).    This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  ACDEH determined that the site met all the LTCP General Criteria.    The site does not meet the Groundwater Media-Specific Criteria due to the presence of a water supply well within 1,000 feet of the subject site.  The well is located approximately 450 feet northeast (upgradient) of the site and was advanced to a depth of approximately 198 feet bgs.  Because the water supply well is located upgradient it is unlikely to intercept the groundwater plume that extends downgradient of the site.  The closest downgradient well, an abandoned well, is located approximately 1,200 feet downgradient of the site.  The closest surface body of water is Glen Echo Creek located at a distance of 400 feet southeast (upgradient) of the site.  Based on the distance and direction from the site, it is not likely that Glen Echo Creek will be affected by the dissolved-phase petroleum hydrocarbon plume associated with the site.  Therefore, ACDEH has determined that under existing conditions, the contaminant plume poses a low threat to the human health and the environment.    The site does not meet the Petroleum Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air Media-Specific Criteria due to the lack of vapor samples collected at a depth of 5 feet below existing foundations.  Due to the likelihood of encountering shallow groundwater, sub-slab vapor samples were collected instead and compared to commercial Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) promulgated by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB).  Concentrations for benzene, ethylbenzene, and naphthalene were substantially below the 2016 commercial ESLs RWQCB.  In the case of naphthalene, the concentration is slightly above the 2019 ESL of 12 µg\/m3.  All other compounds remain below the 2019 commercial ESLs.  Therefore, ACDEH has determined that under existing site conditions the contaminant vapor plume poses a low threat to the human health and the environment as currently developed.    Based on currently available data, the site appears to meet the Direct Contact Media Specific Criteria.  However, not all areas of the former service station were accessible for collection of data, and consequently higher concentrations may be present in unassessed areas beneath the building at the site.  However, in its current configuration and commercial use, site occupants are protected from exposure to Direct Contact with these potential contaminant concentrations.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is an active commercial fueling station located at the northwest corner of the intersection of Pierson Street and MacArthur Boulevard in Oakland, California   This case was opened on January 5, 1990 following the identification of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination associated with the 1989 removal\/replacement of USTs.  City of Oakland sewer easements cross the western and south eastern corner of the site.  At the time the case was opened, the site consisted of a service station operating two 10,000-gallon fuel UST, one 280-gallon waste oil UST (WOT) and vehicle repair service bays.  The current site configuration includes a station building, two 12,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs), and four dispensers on two islands.  The station building consists of a market\/deli and an office area.     In December 1989, the two fuel USTs, WOT and associated product piping were removed.  A hole was observed in the WOT.  Soil samples collected from 6 feet bgs beneath the WOT included 670 mg\/kg TPHg, 5.4 mg\/kg benzene, 8,300 mg\/kg  TPHd, 48,000 mg\/kg TOG, 77 ppb PCE and 15 ppb 1,1,1-TCA.  Metal concentrations were reported to include lead to 340 mg\/kg. Maximum soil concentrations included 3,800 mg\/kg TPHg and 6.1 mg\/kg benzene.  The groundwater sample collected contained 6.7ppb TPHd, 0.61 ppb benzene.  The waste oil tank pit was overexcavated iand approximately 50 cu yd soil removed.  Three groundwater (GW) monitoring wells were installed in April 1990 and an additional GW well was installed in December 1990.  Two additional groundwater monitoring wells were installed in June 2010 to the southwest of the UST pit.  Sewer easements are present on the site, one to the southwest of the waste-oil UST.  TPH odors were discovered emanating from a manhole.  It was found to contain TPH odors registering 500 ppm on a PID in 2010.  The source of the odors appeared to be a leaky manhole (MH2) which was repaired.    Results of the off site plume evaluation conducted in June, 2015 and reported in July 2015 documented free product concentrations of 44,000 ug\/L TPHg in grab groundwater sampled collected from bore SB-13.",

To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as automobile service and repair operations associated with numerous former underground storage tanks..   A former Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Case, Sears Auto Center (Case No. RO0000480), was associated with the Site. In April 2016, the former LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP). At the time of closure, the former LUST case meet all the general and media-specific criteria of the LTCP and there was a low potential for direct contact exposure because of the current land use (at time of closure) as a shopping center with the entire site being paved. On April 16, 2016 the former LUST Case was closed as a commercial site with site management requirements due to residual contamination beneath the Site with the condition that if the property configuration at the time of closure were to change then additional subsurface investigations would be warranted at the Site.  Subsurface investigations are on-going at the subject site to identify potential chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil, soil vapor, and groundwater).and to facilitate development of site-specific corrective actions.        The subject site (the Site) is located in a mixed residential and commercial area of the Northgate-Waverly neighborhood of Oakland and consists of two parcels (Alameda County Assessor Parcel Numbers (APN) 9-684-11 and 9-684-12-1 located at the southeast intersection of Telegraph Avenue and 27th Street.  The Site is bound to the north by 27th and further by commercial business.  The Site is bound to the east by a commercial cash wash and residential homes. To the south, the Site is bounded by 26th Street and furthur by a new residential redevelopment. Various residential lofts and commercial businesses including but not limited to a cosmetics and athethic gym are located west of the Site.  A former Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Case, Sears Auto Center (Case No. RO0000480), was associated with the Site. In April 2016, the former LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP). At the time of closure, the former LUST case meet all the general and media-specific criteria of the LTCP and there was a low potential for direct contact exposure because of the current land use (at time of closure) as a shopping center with the entire site being paved. On April 16, 2016 the former LUST Case was closed as a commercial site with site management requirements due to residual contamination beneath the Site with the condition that if the property configuration at the time of closure were to change then additional subsurface investigations would be warranted at the Site.      The Site currently operates as a one-story, irregular shaped commercial billiard hall and restaurant totaling 19,200 square feet in size with an associated asphalt paved parking lot. The basement area that is approximately 10 feet deep is present under the existing building and operates as a commercial resultant. .     Conceptual redevelopment plans at the Site included a mixed-use commercial and residential 8-story building.  The ground floor is proposed to consist of parking (car stackers), a lobby, and various commercial businesses.  Stories 2 through 8 are proposed for residential units. Additional details regarding the redevelopment plan have not been provided to Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) at this time. However based on a meeting conducted on July 31, 2020 with the responsible party ACDEH understands proposed cut\/fill quantities will include a total of 4,900 cubic yards including approximately 950 cubic yards of cut for the car stackers and appromxately 3,950 cublic yards of fill for the existing basement at the Site.          The Site is approximately 0.91 acres and is currently developed with a vacant single family residential structure with covered garage area and backyard.  Based on information provided in the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Report (Phase I), dated July 9, 2019, prepared by Stantec, the layout of the residential structures have been in the general same configuration since the 1930's.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Site Land-Use: The subject property (APN 4-69-4) is located at 1396 5th Street, between Mandela Parkway and Kirkham Street, in the northwest portion of the City of Oakland.  The case was opened by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) in 2005 in conjunction with a proposed residential redevelopment of the former Red Star Yeast Company manufacturing plant which operated at the site from approximately 1902 until 2003. Extensive excavation of metal impacted soil was conducted in conjunction with site redevelopment which began in 2011, however in 2012 a fire occurred during the construction phase and significantly damaged the site structure and surrounding properties. The remaining structure from the fire consisted of a concrete podium which was removed in April 2016. Additional investigation activities were conducted in 2016 to (1) assess data gaps in the confirmation sampling of the previously excavated areas of the site and assess fill material used to backfill the remedial excavation; and (2) assess soil and groundwater conditions in the vicinity of underground storage tanks discovered in the sidewalk during site development in 2011 as well as the potential for upgradient off-site sources of petroleum contamination. At the time of this case closure, there are no plans to redevelop the property and the site is a vacant dirt lot surrounded by a chain-linked fence and thus the case was closed to the site’s current commercial land-use scenario.     Future Site Management Requirements: Due to residual contamination at the site and due to the current owner not planning further redevelopment, the site is closed to its commercial land use as a vacant lot with site management requirements. If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2. ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    Historic Land-Use \/ Site Investigation\/ Remediation Activities: The primary constituents of concern identified during site assessments conducted from 2004 to 2016 include metals in artificial fill material and low levels of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater. A summary of previous site investigation is provided below.  The site historically operated as a brewery, a yeast and vinegar manufacturing facility from approximately 1900 until 1965, and then solely as a yeast manufacturing plant from approximately 1965 until 2003. As of June 2000, according to a Phase I report, the site had the following:  two cooling towers; many different-sized above ground storage tanks (ASTs); storage buildings for new and used oil; a transformer, where no polychlorinated biphenyl’s (PCBs) were detected; a propane forklift and five electric forklifts; an elevator with hydraulic equipment that used soluble oil since 1978; two boilers; a 3,000-gallon diesel underground storage tank (UST) which fueled two former boilers at the site that was closed in place in 1989; and various sewer pipes, sumps, and drains.  In addition, according to a 1902 Sanborn map, a UST for oil was located under a building in the central area of the site.  During a sewer replacement in 1996, mercury was found in the soil around a floor drain, and flowed into the drain and through a crack in the sewer pipe.  Soil and groundwater were reportedly removed during the cleanup.  However, there is lack of documentation of the investigation, analytical results, and verification of regulatory closure.    Remaining structures were removed or demolished by 2004.  The site was planned for redevelopment as four stories of residential units above a podium garage. Between August 2004 and May 2007, 27 boreholes were advanced, and 39 shallow soil samples and 10 grab groundwater samples were collected, which were analyzed for the following: Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPH-g), diesel (TPH-d), and motor oil (TPH-mo); benzene, toluene, ethylbenzenes and total xylenes (BTEX); methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE); metals; volatile organize compounds (VOCs) and semi-VOCs; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  Analytical results showed elevated TPH-d and TPH-mo in groundwater, and elevated lead in soil likely from imported fill placed throughout the site.    In 2006 the closed-in-place 3,000-gallon diesel UST was removed. Twenty yards of soil were excavated and 6,300 gallons of groundwater pumped from the tank pit.  One soil sidewall sample and one grab groundwater sample were collected.  Analytical results showed TPH-d at 180 µg\/L in groundwater. The case was closed under the oversight of the City of Oakland Fire Department.    In January 2011 a geophysical survey was performed. Pits were excavated around identified structures which were removed. The removed structures included the following: a properly decommissioned water supply well; an elevator piston, a sewer system connection; and structural pilings. Confirmation sampling was performed in each pit, showing elevated lead above the screening level, which required additional excavation.    In March 2011 further characterization was performed with the goal of obtaining closure with unrestricted land use.  Fifteen soil borings and five temporary monitoring wells were advanced at the site.  Sixty shallow soil samples were collected and analyzed for the following: TPH-g, TPH-mo, TPH-d, and metals; and 5 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for TPH-g, TPH-mo, TPH-d, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and semi-VOCs.  Results showed lead contamination both in the fill and in the native soil below the fill.  Groundwater results showed 2400 µg\/L of TPH-mo at the northern area of the site.    In August 2011, remedial excavation occurred and confirmation samples were collected and analyzed for TPH and metals.  The final excavation depths were as follows: 5 feet below ground surface at the northwest area of the property; between 6 and 7 feet bgs at the western half of the property into native soil; 3 feet bgs into native soil at the central eastern portion; and 4 feet bgs at targeted areas of the easternmost area of the site. Most of the deepestConfirmation samples in the western half had lead above the residential San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board’s Environmental Screening Level (ESL) of 80 mg\/kg.  One sample in the eastern portion had lead above the residential ESL.      In September 2011 during the excavation activities, 3 USTs, one 250-gallon, one 2,500-gallon, and one 10,000-gallon, were discovered in the sidewalk at the southern edge of the property along 5th Street.   In November 2011, the 10,000-gallon UST at the corner of Mandela Parkway and 5th Street was left in place and the other two tanks removed under Oakland Fire Department oversight.  A Tank Removal and Closure Report was submitted, but contained inconsistencies. In addition, during excavation activities, a substance that appeared to be oil was found seeping from the north sidewall in the northwest area of the site. Oil and contaminated soil were reportedly removed from on-site. During August and September 2011, approximately 7,000 tons of imported aggregate\/sand mix was put in place as fill, after which development began.  In June 2012, a fire destroyed the project during construction, leaving a concrete podium, which was removed in April 2016.       In June 2016, 9 boreholes were advanced across the site and a total of 27 soil samples and 2 grab groundwater samples were collected and analyzed to address the following data gaps: the lack of documentation of the source and types of quality control used in backfilling the excavation; the need for further characterization of lead in native soil below the fill; and the need for further characterization of soil and groundwater at the areas of the oil seepage from the north sidewall and the former location of temporary monitoring well MW-5 to evaluate for the potential for off-site source of contamination. The aggregate fill was analyzed for PCBs, PAHs, TPH and lead.  The analytical results for the fill showed that some PAHs were elevated above the ESLs for residential land use, but PAHs were below commercial land use ESLs.  Residual PAHs were likely secondary to the fire that occurred at the site.  Lead was not found to be elevated above the commercial or residential ESLs in both fill and native soil samples. Soil samples collected in the vicinity of the north wall seepage were analyzed for TPH, and groundwater samples collected were analyzed for TPH, BTEX, MTBE, and other oxygenates and VOCs.  Soil samples showed concentrations of TPH below residential and commercial Direct Exposure Human Health Risk Levels. Groundwater samples collected in the northern portion of the site at locations upgradient of the former UST locations were analyzed for TPH-g, TPH-d, TPH-mo, BTEX, and VOCs. Groundwater results indicate that there is TPH-g, TPH-d, BTEX and TBA impacts to groundwater in the norther portion of the site. The most likely source of this contamination is the railroad right-of-way immediately north of the site or the former service station located approximately 175 feet north of the site.Three borings were advanced and 6 soil samples collected and 3 grab groundwater samples collected in the areas of the former locations of the two removed USTs and the closed-in-place UST to further characterize these areas for potential contamination. Soil and groundwater samples collected adjacent to the former USTs were low or non-detect.    Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern:There is no potential exposure to chemicals of concern for the current commercial land use as a vacant lot.",

In October 2000 soil bores B-1 to B-10 were installed and grab groundwater concentrations of concern were encountered.  In March 2002 wells MW-1 to MW-4 were installed.  In April 2005 the station was demolished and all USTs and associated piping were removed.  Also beginning in April 2005, a remedial excavation was conducted and removed 5,134 tons of soil, and 25,486 gallons of groundwater were pumped.  In March 2006 soil bores SB-1 to SB-7 were installed.  In September 2006 wells MW-1 to MW-4 were decommissioned to facilitate site redevelopment; including a residential option.  In July 2008 wells MW-5 to MW-8 were installed offsite.  Soil bore SB-10 was installed in January 2011, and soil bores SB-11 to SB-18 were installed in February 2015.  The subject site is currently scheduled for redevelopment as residential land use and investigations have been ongoing to evaluate the property for that purpose.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This case was opened to act as a repository for reports and data generated in accordance with site management requirements associated with the long-term monitoring of the Vapor Mitigation System for select buildings of the residential development.     The Site is the location of a former trucking facility that operated five underground storage tanks (USTs) used for the storage of gasoline, diesel. fresh and spent motor oils, and a tank of unknown contents.  The five USTs were removed between March 1987 and October 2011.  Based on evidence a release occurred during removal of the first two tanks, an unauthorized release form was issued in May 1987 and an LOP case, RO0000039, opened.  Following tank removals, remediation, and monitoring, the LOP case was closed in July 2015 to the existing land use as a commercial (trucking) facility. This SCP case was opened in 2016 following a change in land use to residential.      An Underground Storage Tank Closure Report (USTR,) dated July 17, 2020, documented the removal of one UST from beneath the 17th Street sidewalk area adjacent to the subject case.    Laboratory analysis of the tank contents revealed the presence of several potential chemicals of concern (PCOCs) including total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline (TPHg) at 14 micrograms per liter (ug\/L), TPH as diesel (TPHd) at 21,000 ug\/L and acetone at 16 g\/L.   Following UST removal, additional soil from the base of the excavation was removed to a depth of approximately 11-feet below ground surface (approximately 2-feet below the base of the UST).      In early 2016, ACDEH was requested to review the now closed case file and to consider the site for unrestricted land use, as a residential development was being considered for the site.  A Voluntary Remedial Action Program (also known as Site Cleanup Program -SCP) case, RO0003206,  was open in June 2016.  Meetings including the landowner, consultant, and ACEH were held on May 6, 2016, June 8, 2016, and July 20, 2016 to refine the development plan and address potential data gaps.  At the July 20, 2016 meeting, ACDEH requested a toxicologist be contracted to evaluate the existing data for a determination if additional data is needed for preparation of a risk assessment.

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm    This site is to be entered into the City of Oakland Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.    The subject site is currently in commercial use as an auto dealership and is comprised of three parcels, APN 9-730-1-3 (3359 Broadway), 9-730-1-4 (327 34th Street), and 9-730-3 (3329 Broadway) located in Oakland, California.  The site is located 700 feet north-northwest and up\/cross gradient of a non-culvertized section of Glen Echo Creek located in Oak Glen Park. Lake Merritt is located approximately 4,000 feet south of the property.  The direction of site groundwater flow is towards the south-southwest.    A 1,000 gallon gasoline UST and a 1,000 gallon waste oil UST were removed in March 1993 along with the associated fuel dispenser located in the building.  Elevated concentrations of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon as gasoline (TPHg), TPH as diesel (TPHd), methyl tert butyl ether (MtBE), and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) were found in soil and groundwater samples. Between 1993 and 2009 eleven groundwater monitoring wells were installed to evaluate the dissolved groundwater plume. Interim remedial actions occurred between 2004 and 2011 and included dual phase extraction (DPE) and insitu chemical oxidation (ISCO) injection.  Full-scale remediation using DPE occurred between June 2012 and June 2014.    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP). The case meets all the general and media-specific criteria of the LTCP with the exception of media-specific criteria of direct contact to outdoor air.  A waste oil UST was removed from the site and no soil samples collected from depths less than ten feet below ground surface were analyzed for polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  ACEH has made the determination that there is low potential for direct contact exposure because the entire site is paved and the site is in current commercial land use.  Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, Alameda County Environmental health (ACEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    This site is to be entered into the City of Oakland Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is a commercial building located at the corner of Solano Way and 20th Avenue in Oakland, California.  Surrounding land use is commercial and industrial.  Two underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed from the sidewalk in front of 1200 20th Avenue on January 19, 1994.  The tanks were oriented roughly north-south within a common excavation.  Both tanks showed evidence of corrosion holes and the western tank had a split along the seam at the south end of the tank.  Due to significant soil staining observed beneath the tanks, the excavation was extended to a depth of approximately 15 feet bg.  The lateral extent of the excavation was limited by 20th Avenue to the north, Solano Way to the west, and a gas line and the building foundation to the south.  Following overexcavation, contamination was still observed along the western sidewall of the excavation.      Three soil borings were advanced and completed as monitoring wells in February 1995.  The three monitoring wells (MW-1, MW-2, and MW-3) were constructed to depths of 30, 35, and 30 feet bgs, respectively.  TPHg and benzene were detected in groundwater from well MW-1, which is located immediately adjacent to the former USTs, at concentrations of 1,900 and 92 ppb, respectively.    Two additional soil borings were advanced south of the former USTs in June 1999.  TPHg, BTEX, and MTBE were not detected in soil samples from the two borings.  No groundwater samples were collected from the borings because groundwater was reportedly not encountered in the borings.    The three groundwater monitoring wells were monitored sporadically from February 1995 to August 2001.  TPHg has been detected in groundwater from well MW-1 at concentrations ranging from 23,000 ppb in July 1998 to 1,900 ppb in June 2007.    An additional investigation consisting of soil gas sampling (SG-1), a geophysical survey, and soil borings (B-3 through B-9), was conducted in March and April 2009.  Soil gas sampling was attempted at two depths (5 and 10 feet bgs) at location SG-1, which is located within an office space inside the building adjacent to the former USTs.  However, it was not possible to collect soil vapor samples at either depth due to the high vacuum conditions associated with fine-grained soils in the borehole.      A resistivity survey along with continuous coring and conductivity logging in the soil borings was used to identify coarse-grained soils that appear to be within buried stream channels.  The stream channels are present beneath portions of the site and appear to intersect some monitoring wells but not others.  The distribution of the stream channels in relation to the monitoring wells affects the apparent hydraulic gradient observed from the monitoring wells.  Historically, the calculated hydraulic gradient has been north-northeast, which is uphill and highly unlikely.  Consistently lower groundwater elevations observed in well MW-2 is more likely the result of vertical gradients associated with movement of groundwater in the buried stream channels.  Groundwater flow at the site more likely follows the topography and regional flow to the southwest.  Soil and grab groundwater data from the soil borings indicated that the extent of contamination is limited to the vicinity of the former USTs.     In October 2009, one additional soil boring (B-10) was advanced and a subslab soil vapor sample (SG-1) was collected.   SG-1 was collected from the subslab space immediately below the floor of an office space adjacent to the former USTs.  Benzene was detected at a concentration of 9.5 micrograms per cubic meter.  Based on the subslab soil vapor sample, the hazard quotient was less than one and the cumulative excess cancer risk was estimated to be 0.18 per million.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site is an active fueling station located at 66 MacArthur Blvd. (based on APN) in Oakland, CA.  The case was opened in 1992 when contaminated soil was encountered during dispensing system upgrade.    In May 1992 the dispensers and product piping were modified. Soil sampling revealed the presence of 1,700 mg\/kg TPHg and 3.1 mg\/kg benzene beneath the southern dispenser island.  Subsequent to the discovery of petroleum hydrocarbons, three onsite monitoring wells were installed in October 1992. Initial sampling of the wells on 11\/03\/1992 revealed 260,000 ug\/L TPHg and 2,300 ug\/L benzene in groundwater.  Two additional on-site wells were installed in March 1996 followed by the  June 1999 installation of three additional wells located in the street adjacent to the site.  To aid in the plume delineation, wells MW9, MW10 and MW11 were installed across MacArthur Blvd., farther down gradient of the site in December 2001.    In August 1994 a 280-gallon waste-oil UST (WOT) was removed and replaced with a 520-gallon WOT.  No holes were observed int the WOT; however, soil samples from the WOT pit revealed up to 1,400 mg\/kg TPHd, 960 mg\/kg TPHg, 2.2 mg\/kg benzene, and several VOCs and SVOCs, including PAHs having a BaPe concentration of 5.62 mg\/kg (over excavated) with residual BaPe of 3.69 mg\/kg at 9' bgs- the shallowest WOT sample.      In May 1998 two 12,000-gallon gasoline USTs, one 520-gallon WOT, two hydraulic lifts, two dispenser islands, associated product piping and the station building were removed from the site in conjunction with station replacement.  Fuel tank pit concentrations of TPHg up to 2,000 mg\/kg, 9.7 mg\/kg benzene and 12 mg\/kg MTBE were reported in soil from the fuel tank pit.  Soil beneath the dispensers were reported to contain 15 mg\/kg TPHg.  TPHg, TPHd, BTEX and MTBE were reported at concentrations below the laboratory reporting limits for the waste oil UST.  1,252.78 tons of soil were reported removed for off-site disposal at the time of station upgrades.    Six off site monitoring wells installed between June, 1999 and December, 2001 for plume definition.     An ozone sparge system was operated between April 8, 2002 and March 7, 2013.  On March 6, 2013 ACDEH authorized ceasing system operation accompanied with resumption of quarterly sampling to monitor rebound.  Groundwater monitoring halted after 3 events.",

Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on Geotracker. A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm     The subject site is currently in commercial use as a food products supplier business (Current APN: 44-5020-5-58, former APN: 44-5020-5-32).  San Leandro Creek, the closest surface water body is located 480 feet northeast of and up\/cross gradient to the site at its closest point. The direction of groundwater flow is towards the southwest- southwest based on the closed Fuel Leak Case RO0000869, also located at 155 98th Avenue.    Two generations of underground storage tanks (USTs) have been located at the site. A case (RO0000869) was opened after the first generation USTs were removed in 1994 and was subsequently closed in 1996.    The second generation of USTs consisted of an 8,000 gallon gasoline UST, a 12,000 gallon diesel UST, and a dispenser located on top of the USTs that were removed in March 2009.  A water sample collected from the tank excavation detected up to 25,000 micrograms per liter (ug\/L) total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline, 8,790 ug\/L TPH as diesel, and 1,050 ug\/L benzene. In July 2014 six soil borings, B-1 through B-6 were advanced on four sides of the both the 2nd and 1st generation USTs and one soil vapor point SVP-1 was installed between UST pit and the building.  TPH as diesel was the only analyte detected in soil at 21 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg).  TPH as diesel, benzene, and MTBE were detected in grab groundwater at 510 ug\/L, 0.23 ug\/L, and 4.8 ug\/L, respectively.    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP). The case meets all the general and media-specific criteria of the LTCP with the exception of media-specific criteria of direct contact to outdoor air.  ACEH has made the determination that there is low potential for direct contact exposure because the entire site is paved and the site is in current commercial land use.    Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, Alameda County Environmental health (ACEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    This site is to be entered into the City of Oakland Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.",

The site was used as a Shell Service Station from approximately 1973 to 1978, then used as an automotive service or smog test station.  In 1990 five USTs (three gasoline, one diesel, and one waste oil) were removed from the site.  A URF was filed on 12\/19\/1990.  Between 1993 and 1996, soil and groundwater investigations were conducted at the site consisting of soil boring and monitoring well installations.  In 1999 oxygen release compound (ORC) was introduced into MW-3 and MW-4.  Three soil borings were installed on-site in 2012 to provide additional information for a Site Conceptual Model which was submitted in 2014.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The subject property (site) is a commercial facility located between Manila Avenue and Broadway, near the intersection with 38th Street in Oakland, California.Site investigation activities have been conducted at the site since 1997.  Interim remediation was initiated but has not been completed.    Six underground storage tanks (USTs) were formerly located on-site. Two were located under the sidewalk on 38th Street and four inside the building. UST  capacities have been variously reported as ranging from 800 to 4,000 gallons.  The USTs reportedly contained Stoddard solvent (TPH-ss), fuel oil and possibly  waste oil. The USTs inside the building were interconnected through a series of pipes and valves. Reportedly, in the late 1970s a significant release of TPH-ss  occurred when a new piping system was installed (Figure 2). In 1997, the six USTs were abandoned in place, by backfilling with either cement-sand slurry or  pea gravel, by HK2, Inc of San Mateo. HK2 conducted the UST closure and reporting. UST-1 through UST-4, inside the building, contained residual liquid. On  June 5 and 9, 1997, HK2 delivered a 1,500-gallon aboveground storage tank (AST) to the site, measured the amount of liquid in each of these four USTs,  collected samples of residual liquid from each, pumped the residual liquid into the AST, rinsed the USTs, pumped the rinsate into the AST, and inspected the inside of each UST with video camera. The report indicates presence of holes in UST-1 and UST-3, which contained TPH-ss; the report also indicates that on June 11, 1997, HK2 pumped out groundwater that had recharged into UST-1 and UST-4.  This indirectly indicates the presence of hole(s) in UST-1 and UST-4 also. A total of 81 drums containing diesel fuel, TPH-ss, oil, and various wastes were removed from the site and properly disposed of.      Based on results of past site investigations and groundwater monitoring data, soil and groundwater have been impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons and  chlorinated solvents. The source area for TPH-ss appears to have been formed by chemical releases from the former indoor USTs and their associated piping  system, as well as from the washing machine operation. As noted above, a significant release was reportedly discovered in the late 1970s, when new  underground piping connecting the USTs to the washing machines was found to have been installed incorrectly.

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm  Four USTs were removed from the site in October 1989. Site investigation activities were conducted in 1990, 1993, 1994, 1997, 2009, 2010, and 2015 to evaluate the extent of subsurface impacts to soil and groundwater from the leaking USTs. Site investigation activities conducted on site included: over excavation during UST removal, installation of 32 soil borings (MW-1 through MW-12, BH-1 through BH-3, SB-1 through SB-8, MW-1R and MW-7R) and seven excavation soil samples. Groundwater monitor and sampling was conducted 1990 through 2017.  Analytical data from soil and groundwater samples indicated that the subsurface beneath the site had been impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons and fuel-related constituents including, but not limited TPHg, TPHd, BTEX, and naphthalene. Analyses of halogenated VOCs, SVOCs, and metals were additionally conducted on soil and groundwater samples during the investigations.  This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH determined that the site met all the LTCP General Criteria and Media Specific Criteria. Therefore, case closure is granted for the current commercial land use as a vacant lot with no structures or buildings.  If a change in land use to any residential, commercial other than as a vacant lot with no structures or buildings, or conservative land use, or if any site redevelopment is planned, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  Any below grade work require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.",

This ESA identified several recognized environmental conditions (RECs) which had not yet been evaluated which are outlined below:    1) On-site historic gasoline and oil service station;  2) Off-site historic gasoline and oil service station at 570 16th Street (Oak Grove South);  3) Off-site leaking underground storage tank case adjacent to the Site at 1700 Jefferson Street;  4) Multiple adjacent historical and active dry cleaning facilities; and  5) Former adjacent historical auto-station (Mash Petroleum Inc.) at 1721 Jefferson Street.    These RECs were investigated as part of a soil and soil vapor subsurface investigation conducted by Rincon Consultants, Inc. in February 2019 on behalf of the Oakland Housing Authority (the property owner). The results of this subsurface investigation indicate that contaminants associated with petroleum hydrocarbons, lead, and halogenated hydrocarbons are present in soil and soil vapor at the Site. At this time, further investigation is warranted to identify the source and characterize the extents and stability of of subsurface contamination at and in the vicinity of the Site. Further investigation is also warranted to evaluate potentially complete and unacceptable exposure pathways at the Site to determine if implementation of remediation and\/or mitigation measures are necessary for the protection of human health and the environment.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Safety-Kleen Oakland facility includes a 8,900 square foot office and warehouse building within a commercial and industrial area of Oakland, CA.  The site is currently used for storage of waste materials in the warehouse prior to transfer of the wastes to other facilities for processing.  Safety-Kleen began operations at the site in 1975.  Two underground storage tanks were previously located between the Safety-Kleen building and a neighboring business.  The USTs were apparently removed in 2007 under the oversight of Oakland Fire Department.    During a preliminary site assessment in May 1986, total petroleum hydrocarbons as mineral spirits (TPHms) were detected in soil samples collected from three soil borings advanced to a depth of 20 feet bgs.  Two of the borings were converted to 2-inch diameter monitoring wells. Separate-phase product was observed floating on the water table in both monitoring wells (SK-1 and SK-3).    In June 1988, a soil gas survey was conducted to define the extent of contamination.  Thirteen soil vapor samples were analyzed for TPHms.  A TPHms vapor plume was identified in the parking lot and loading dock area and was inferred to extend beneath both adjacent buildings and the vacant lot to the north.     Nine monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-9) were installed on and around the site in July 1995.  VOCs were detected in groundwater from each of the wells sampled.  Because trichloroethene (TCE) was detected at elevated concentrations in the upgradient groundwater samples, it was assumed that a plume from an off-site source was migrating to the Safety Kleen site.  Four additional monitoring wells were installed around the periphery of the VOC plume from August 18 through September 12, 1989.  Monitoring well MW-13 was installed with a discrete screen interval in the lower portion of the uppermost aquifer to evaluate the vertical extent of contamination.    Between May 31 and July 5, 1990, three single-walled USTs were removed and replaced with two 12,000-gallon USTs.  Groundwater and product was encountered at a depth of approximately 8 feet bgs during the UST removal .  Approximately 100 gallons of product and 34,000 gallons of water were removed and treated.  TPHms was detected in eight soil samples collected during the UST removal.  In conjunction with the UST installation, soil vapor extraction (SVE) piping and a product recovery well were installed in the excavation.  A small waste oil tank located north of the Safety-Kleen facility was also removed on July 2, 1990.    The SVE system began operation in June 1993.  pilot test was conducted on January 18, 1990.  From start-up through November 11, 1998, the SVE system removed approximately 5,400 pounds of TPHms.  A product pumping system was installed in recovery well RW-1 to removed separate-phase product from the surface of the water table and began operation on January 19, 1993,  Due to failure of the recovery pump, the recovery pump was replaced by a passive skimmer in November 1995.  On August 5, 1998, the passive skimmer was removed and replaced by suspension of oxygen releasing compound in recovery well RW-1.The total volume of mineral spirits product removed was approximately 444 gallons.    Safety-Kleen entered into a Corrective Action Consent Agreement with the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) on September 21, 2009.  Under the terms of the consent agreement, Safety-Kleen submitted an RFI (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Facility Investigation) Work Plan on April 9, 2010, to describe how contaminated media will be investigated. DTSC provided comments on June 14, 2010, and Safety-Kleen submitted a revised Work Plan on July 23, 2010. The revised Work Plan is under review. Safety-Kleen also submitted a Health Risk Assessment Work Plan on August 20, 2008, which was approved by DTSC on December 15, 2009. After the contamination is fully characterized, Safety-Kleen will conduct a Health Risk Assessment in accordance with theHRA Work Plan and propose corrective measures for the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is an active auto repair facility but was a gasoline service station from circa 1941 until 1990.  Surrounding land use is mixed commercial and residential.  A residential building borders the site to the west and MacArthur Boulevard borders the site to the north.  The developed area of the site is generally flat but the surrounding natural topography slopes to the south.  A retaining wall up to approximately 8 feet high borders the site to the south and southeast.  As a result, the southern end of the site is elevated up to approximately 8 feet above the surrounding land surface to the south and southeast.      On October 3, 1990, three USTs (two 1,000-gallon gasoline USTs and one 500-gallon gasoline UST) were removed from an underground concrete vault.  Later investigation in 2009 found that the vault did not have a bottom.  All of the USTs had been reportedly used for storage of gasoline.  During the tank removal, strong petroleum hydrocarbon odors and discoloration was observed in the soil overburden surrounding the USTs.  Six soil samples collected during the UST and product line removal contained Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) at concentrations up to 450 ppm.    On January 7, 1993, two monitoring wells were installed adjacent to the former UST vault and one monitoring well was installed east of the former USTs.  TPHg was detected only in soil samples from well MW-2, which was installed immediately south of the former USTs.  The maximum concentration of TPHg in soil was 1,460 ppm detected in a soil sample collected at a depth of 10.0 feet bgs from well MW-2.    On June 24, 1996, 12 direct push soil borings (GP-1A through GP-9) were advanced to depths ranging from 7 to 20 feet bgs.  TPHg was detected in 3 of 13 soil samples collected at concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 860 ppm.  Benzene was detected in 4 of 13 soil samples collected at concentrations ranging from 0.006 to 3.1 ppm.  Three additional groundwater monitoring wells (MW-4 through MW-6) were installed on June 27, 1996.  Floating product was encountered in well MW-2 and MW-5.  A soil vapor extraction (SVE) pilot test was performed using monitoring wells MW-1, MW-2, and MW-5 on July 10 and 11, 1996.  Hydraulic slug tests performed in wells MW-1 and MW-3 concluded that the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer materials at the site was 1.0x10-05 to 2.6x10-05 centimeters per second.      An SVE system using well MW-1, MW-2, and MW-5 began operation on September 19, 2000.  On October 23, 2000, air sparging was initiated in wells MW-2 and MW-5 to help remove free-phase product.  SVE operations continued from September 2000 through April 2001 but were terminated due to low hydrocarbon removal rates.  A total of 16.5 pounds of hydrocarbons were removed during SVE operations.      In December 2006, five direct push soil borings (B-1 through B-5) were advanced in the area immediately outside the concrete vault that contained the former USTs.  TPHg and benzene were detected in grab groundwater samples from borings B-1 through B-5 at concentrations up to 72,000 ppb and 1,100 ppb, respectively.  These results indicated that residual contamination remains in soil and groundwater surrounding the concrete vault.  Nine soil vapor probes were installed at the site in January 2007.  The maximum concentration of benzene detected in the soil vapor samples from the nine probes was 15 micrograms per cubic meter (µg\/m3).      One additional soil vapor probe was installed within the center of the concrete vault on August 13, 2009.  In addition, one soil boring (SB-6) was advanced within the concrete vault to confirm that the vault did not have a bottom.  Soil vapor samples were collected from all 10 soil vapor probes on August 25, 2009.  The maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene detected in the soil vapor samples were 17,000 µg\/m3 and 4.4 µg\/m3, respectively.    On May 6, 2005 a Petition for Closure was submitted to the State Water Resources Control Board (State Board).  Additional characterization was conducted between December 2006 and 2009.",

Currently the site is developed as an eight story independent senior living complex which includes paved parking, landscaping, and hardscapes. Historically portions of the site operated as residential dwellings and commercial retail businesses between the 1900s and the 1970s including a grocery store\/meat market (1920s-1930s) and an equipment company between the 1960s and 1970s.  A dry cleaning business operated on the northern portion of the property between the 1950s and 1970s.  No evidence of a release at the subject site was identified during record review.  In the late 1970s, the Site was redeveloped as the current use.  Property improvement activities are currently being proposed to be completed in phases and will include rehabilitation of 100 apartment units and upgrades and repairs to the building exterior, building systems, and common areas    Subsurface investigations were performed at the site in August 2017 and January 2018, respectively.  These investigations included collection of soil, sub-slab vapor, soil gas, and groundwater samples.  Data indicates that volatile organic compounds, some of which are potentially sourced from a previously existing dry cleaner at the site, or from nearby potentially contaminated sites, have been found in soil, soil gas, and groundwater at the Site. Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) was reported in soil, groundwater, and sub-slab vapor in the vicinity of the former dry cleaning building.  As a result, this case was opened.      Subsequent investigations are currently planned to delineate the lateral extent of PCE in soil gas outside of the building footprint and define the source and extent of PCE in groundwater on- and off-site.  As a condition of potential case closure, a vapor mitigation system (VMS) will be installed during construction rehabilitation activities to mitigate potential impacts of vapor intrusion to indoor air from residual chemicals of concern in soil gas at the site into occupied structures.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In February 1989 three USTs were removed and confirmation soil sampling in the tank pits confirmed that an unauthorized release to the subsurface had occurred. In October 1989 groundwater monitoring wells were installed to evaluate the dissolved phase plume; high concentrations of dissolved phase petroleum hydrocarbons were detected beneath the site. In December 2006 one UST was removed and confirmation soil sampling detected elevated levels of hydrocarbon contamination in soil. Several phases of investigation were completed between 2006 and 2009, and  interim remedial action performed  between October 2006 and July 2008 removed 620 cubic yards of contaminated  soil and 15,000 gallons of contaminated water. In March 2009  verification soil vapor sampling detected high concentrations of 15,000,000 µg\/m3  TPHg and 33,000 µg\/m3  benzene in soil vapor samples.    This site is situated at the eastern end of the currently known extent of paleochannels that extends beneath Oakland and Emeryville for a distance of over 1,500 feet (see attached mapped paleochannel network).  This has allowed the migration of free-phase concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons (mineral spirits and gasoline) over that distance (not the 250 feet per the often cited LLNL study).  There are 7 known sites that have comingled plumes, and innocent property owners are involved.  Continuing work at this site appears to extend the paleochannel network to the northeast of this site.  This recent work (2009 and continuing as of this date, and thus not fully reported yet) is based on geophysical conductivity profiles (fine vs. granular sediments) upgradient and downgradient of the site, as well as soil vapor sampling beneath the site and upgradient of the site.  Onsite soil vapor sampling appears to map out two principal paleochannels beneath the site.  Soil vapor concentrations within those paleochannels for TPHg are up to 15,000,000 ug\/m3 (29,000 ug\/m3 ESL) and for benzene 53,000 ug\/m3 (280 ug\/m3 ESL); these are one to two orders of magnitude above their respective commercial ESLs (see attached map data submittal).  The recent, on-going, and currently unreported work appears to have located one and perhaps two unreported UST locations north of 41st Street (currently unlisted as the data has not been fully reported).  These may be the source of soil vapor concentrations beneath the subject site; however, this is not fully understood due to the current and on-going nature of the data at present.  The elevated soil vapor concentrations are mapped to extend to the south of the subject site (via the paleochannel network) to older residential properties and low income housing that border the subject site on the south (over 300 feet from their potential source).  These have been unevaluated for vapor intrusion, but the work is already approved, but is pending the resolution of offsite access difficulties.  Due to offsite access difficulties, ACEH letters requesting \/ requiring offsite access of several parcels are likely to be issued shortly.  Two of the homes are reported to have basements.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site History:    401 High Street: Richfield Oil Company owned the 401 High Street property from 1946 to 1975 and operated a bulk petroleum distribution facility from 1946 to 1967. From 1955 to 1975, American Mineral Spirits Company, Western (AMSCO-W), a joint venture between Richfield Oil Company and Pure Oil Company, operated a bulk terminal for storing, shipping, and receiving chemical products on the property. Pure Oil Company was bought by Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) in 1965. In 1975, Union Oil bought Richfield Oil Company’s share of AMSCO-W. The new entity, Union Chemical Division of Unocal, operated the bulk terminal until 1991. The bulk terminal included a tank farm containing 41 12,000-gallon underground storage tanks (USTs) and 8 aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) for fuels, fuel-related chemicals, and solvents. In 2005, Unocal Corporation merged with Chevron Corporation to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron. A major spill occurred at the northwest edge of the 401 High Street property on July 5, 1983, when 23,300 gallons of toluene was spilled during rail car off-loading at the Unocal tank farm. Unocal estimated that there were between 3,600 and 4,000 gallons of toluene in an undissolved fraction (free phase) in the subsurface, an undetermined portion of which migrated northwest across the property line onto the parcel owned by NEU Investment Corp. and onto the 411 High Street property. In addition, investigations at the 401 High Street property have revealed that soil and groundwater have been impacted by various solvent chemicals and petroleum constituents associated with the former Unocal chemical distribution facility operations. The 401 High Street property was subsequently redeveloped along with 301 High Street (located along High Street) as the existing self-storage facility by the Crist Property Company, and was sold in 2003 to the current owner, Las Vegas II Storage, LLC, now known as Oakland High Street Storage Partners, L.P.    411 High Street: Richfield Oil Company owned and operated a petroleum storage facility in the southern portion of the 411 High Street property from 1946 through 1967. The facility included two large buildings, three ASTs with capacities greater than 50,000 gallons each, six smaller ASTs with capacities less than 50,000 gallons each, a loading rack and numerous product pipelines and manifolds. Gasoline, diesel, and motor oil were stored in the ASTs. The former tanks and associated aboveground piping were removed from the property by ARCO by 1975. The property has been affected by migration of a toluene plume emanating from the 1983 spill on the 401 High Street property. From 1967 through 1975, the northern parcel of the 411 property was subleased from AMSCO-W, first to Earl Foster, and then in 1972 to Frank Peckett dba the Foster Chemical Company. Foster Chemical mainly operated a fish fertilizer packaging facility on the northern parcel of the 411 property, where four 2,000-gallon USTs, four 6,000-gallon USTs, and a 500-gallon heating oil UST were located. The contents and usage of the eight larger USTs are unknown. In 1975, ARCO sold the property to Mr. William Balfrey who immediately sold it to the current owners, the Richard Koch 411 High Street Annuity Trust and Nancy Koch 411 High Street Annuity Trust. The site was occupied by the Big B Lumberteria lumber yard until 1996 (the Big B retail store was located at 301 High Street). It was subsequently occupied by ITEL Terminals Inc. to store and repair shipping containers from 1996 to 2000. From 2000 to the present, the site has been occupied by First Transit Company as a commercial passenger van storage and maintenance facility. During the tenancy of these occupants subsequent to ARCO, there were no USTs or ASTs installed or operated on the property. In 2000, ARCO merged with BP Amoco P.L.C. to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of BP. Investigations at the property have revealed that soil and groundwater have been impacted by various solvent chemicals and petroleum constituents associated with the former ARCO and possibly Foster Chemical operations.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The site is currently used, and has been used since approximately 1981, as an auto repair shop.  On December 29, 1993 one 1,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tank (UST) was removed from the site; several tank top holes were noted near the fill port.  Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) were reported in soil but no groundwater was encountered to sample at the time.  On July 20, 1994, one 280-gallon waste-oil UST was removed from the site; no holes were noted or reported.  Up to 3,400 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) TPH as diesel (TPHd) and 6,000 mg.kg oil and grease were detected in soil samples.  On September 8, 2000, three monitoring wells were installed.  TPHg, TPHd, and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and total xylenes) were detected in groundwater samples.  No MTBE or semi-volatile organics were detected.  Trace concentrations of Tetrachloroethene (PCE) and Trichloroethene (TCE) were detected in soil beneath the former waste oil UST but the concentrations were below the February 2016 RWQCB ESLs for residential soil.  Concentrations of PCE and TCE were not detected in groundwater collected from the three wells.    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP).  Naphthalene and PAHs have not been tested for in soil between the depths of 0 and 5 feet bgs.  However, under the current land use as an auto repair facility the site is paved with very minor offsite landscaped areas along the street; resulting in a low potential for direct contact exposure under the current land use.  Therefore, case closure is granted for the current commercial land use.    If a change in land use to any residential, commercial other than the current land use as an auto repair facility, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2 ACEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.    Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    This site is to be entered into the City of Oakland Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.",

Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on Geotracker. A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm     The subject site is currently in commercial use as a gasoline service station (Current APN: 34-2290-6-2, 34-2290-6-3, former APN: 34-2290-6-1, 34-2290-5 and 34-2290-6).  The tidal canal, the closest surface water body is located 1,800 feet southwest and down gradient to the site at its closest point. The direction of groundwater flow is towards the southwest.    The underground storage tanks (USTs) associated with fuel leak case RO0000491 consisted of a 6,000 gallon, an 8,000 gallon, and a 10,000 gallon gasoline UST, and a 1,000 gallon waste oil UST that were removed in April 1987. Petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations greater than 1,000 parts per million were detected in soil samples taken during the UST removal indicating that an unauthorized release from the USTs had occurred at the site.    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP). The case meets all the general and media-specific criteria of the LTCP.    Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    This site is to be entered into the City of Oakland Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.",

Soil samples collected beneath the 1,000 gallon gasoline UST detected 27 mg\/kg TPHg and 5.5 mg\/kg benzene indicated an unauthorized release of petroleum hydrocarbons had occurred and this Leaking Underground Fuel Tank (LUFT) case was opened to investigate the release.    Environmental investigations have been ongoing since 1993 and have included installation of a groundwater monitoring well network and collection of soil, groundwater and soil gas samples. Interim remedial excavation was conducted in 1993 and removed 360 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the former waste oil UST to a depth of 18 feet bgs.  An ozone pilot test was proposed for the site in 2008 but was never implemented. The current property owner intends to redevelop the site with a single family residence and is working on preparing a corrective action plan for review and approval by Alameda County Environmental Health. This case is in the State Water Boards Expedited Claim Account Pilot Program  (ECAP).",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "From approximately 1928 to 1964 the property housed the Panama Refining Company, Mileage Gasoline Company, and Golden Gate Oil Company which conducted oil refining, storage, and\/or sales with three above ground storage tanks (ASTs) a 20,000 gallon, and two 15,000 gallon ASTs. Beginning in 1972, the property has been occupied by Equipment Fabrication Corporation which installed and utilized three, 500-gallon underground storage tanks (USTs) on the eastern edge of the property bordering 45th Avenue. By June 1986 of the three USTs two were reportedly in use for storage of gasoline and paint thinner. The USTs were reportedly removed in 1991 without agency oversight or documentation. A geophysical survey conducted in 2013 indicated the former USTs were removed from the Site.    An environmental investigation was conducted in November 2013  which found petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil and groundwater samples collected adjacent to the former locations of the three underground storage tanks.  A case (RO0003133) was opened in Alameda County Department of Environmental Health's Local Oversight Program (LOP) for the three USTs. In 2018, remedial actions were undertaken which consisted of excavation and removal of soil at the former UST locations in an area of approximately 12 feet by 8 feet by 7 feet in depth. Following the remedial excavation, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health closed the Site in June of 2020. Due to the extensive industrial history at the property, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health has required that any future subsurface work at the property may only proceed following the use of the approved Site Management Plan (SMP) and recordation of a Land Use Covenant (LUC) on the property was required as part of the closure process.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    In September and October 2014, two Phase I Environmental Site Assessments were performed for the eight parcels, located at 2302 – 2342 Valdez and 2321 – 2335 Waverly Street to assist Wood Partners with due diligence for acquisition and redevelopment of the site. The Phase I’s identified several Recognized Environmental Concerns associated with historic land use at and in the vicinity of the site including closed Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Cleanup Case No. RO0000807 associated with the southernmost parcel of the site located at 2302 Valdez Street. Alameda County Department of Environmental Health opened this Site Cleanup Program Case (RO0003149) to provide regulatory oversight during redevelopment of the site with a seven-story mixed-use facility with below grade parking, street level commercial space, and upper floor residential units.    To evaluate risk to construction workers during site development and occupants of the new facility, site investigation activities were conducted in 2014 and 2015 to assess concentrations of potential chemicals of concern in soil, groundwater and soil vapor from historic land use at the site and concentrations remaining after excavation of the new foundation. Subsurface investigations indicated that remedial excavation would be required to remove soil with elevated levels of petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy meatal and disposed of off-Site at Class I and Class II regulated landfills. During site redevelopment, soil was excavated up to approximately 14 feet below ground surface across the site with a deeper excavation (approximately 18 feet bgs) for the elevator pit. Due to the natural slope of the land surface, limited excavation was required to be conducted along Waverly Street for the site redevelopment. Approximately 77 tons of Class I Federal Resource conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous material, 1,882 tons of Class I State of California Non-RCRA hazardous material, and 10,350 tons of class II non-hazardous material was excavated and disposed of at off-site permitted disposal facilities. Confirmation soil sampling was conducted at the base and perimeter of the excavation and verified that the residual concentrations of chemicals of concern in soil at the site are below the applicable Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) promulgated by the 2019 San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board for direct exposure human health risk for commercial facilities and construction workers and background levels for metals in the San Francisco Bay Area, with the exception of one sidewall sample (SP-123-2.5) where the lead concentration was 230 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg). Based on the construction elements of the mixed-use building and below grade parking garage, there are no complete pathways for direct contact or potential vapor intrusion risk from residual subsurface contamination as a result of an 8-inch thick concrete foundation and ventilation within the underground parking garage.    ACDEH evaluated this SCP case for closure consistent with the Remedial Action Objectives for the site as well as applicable ESLs for soil, groundwater and soil vapor, and determined that residual subsurface contamination at the site presents a low risk to human health and the environment. Therefore, case closure was granted for the current mixed-use development with two levels of underground parking, at grade commercial floors, and overlying residential units.",

On July 6, 2000, AEI advanced four borings in the suspected area of the former tanks and dispensers.  TPHg, TPHd and benzene were detected in soil at maximum concentrations of 1300 mg\/kg, 200 mg\/kg and 1.5 mg\/kg, respectively.  Up to 620 µg\/L TPHg, 380 µg\/L TPHd and 12µg\/L benzene were detected in groundwater.  Subsequently monitoring wells were installed in 2005 and sheen has been observed in 5 of the wells.  A tank removal permit was finalized for the site in 1967 indicating that the two gasoline storage tanks and dispenser island were planned to be removed.  No documentation was provided indicating the USTs had been removed.  Tanks may remain beneath sidewalk.   Meetings held to move case forward. A soil, groundwater &amp; soil vapor investigation was approved in 2018.  The report has not been submitted for review.       WP submitted 12-29-2017 to address data gaps.  Boring placement based on assumed groundwater flow direction.  ACDEH denied WP as discussed in 3-02-2018 meeting and requested revised WP to address contaminant distribution and GW conditions related to the LUFT case.",

The 1721 Webster Street site redevelopment project will be from lot line to lot line across the property and consist of six levels of parking, one below grade and five above grade, with retail and office space fronting Webster Street on the ground and fourth floor, respectively. Above the  sixth parking level is the amenities level containing a fitness center, party room, media center, conference rooms, lounge, and three residential units. Above the amenities level are eighteen floors of residential living spaces in different configurations (e.g., two-bedroom, one-bedroom, or studio apartments). Above the last residential level is a skylounge area with an upper and lower roof terrace, skylounge, and pool. A portion of this level also houses part of the mechanical roof  deck. The top level houses more of the mechanical roof deck as well as the elevator mechanical control room.    The Site comprises two separate lots that are currently developed from lot line to lot line. The southern portion of the property has been assigned Alameda County Assessor’s Parcel Number (APN): 008-0624-7, and the northern parcel is 008-0624-6. Existing site improvements include two slab on-grade buildings constructed in 1930. The southern half is two stories fronting Webster Street and a single story beyond that. The northern portion is two stories. The buildings are constructed of cinder block and brick walls and have wooden trusses supporting wooden roofing systems.    The southern portion of the property is occupied by a 14,000-square foot structure that was mainly used for vehicle parking and was owned and operated by Douglas Parking Company. Former retail\/commercial spaces along Webster Street frontage of the building included Coloso Coffee, Pablo Brady Hair Salon, RAWR (cat food), and Amanda Kate Hill (AKH) Fitness and Nutrition. Above the retail\/commercial spaces along Webster Street frontage of the building were the offices of Douglas Parking Company.The northern portion of the property is occupied by a 7,500-square foot structure used mainly for vehicle parking though there is some storage space on the ground floor.

To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as automobile sales and repair operations with associated former underground storage tanks.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil, soil vapor, and groundwater).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include the hazardous material survey and abatement of the existing onsite building and hardscape; demolition of existing Site buildings and above ground infrastructure; remediation and\/or off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; remediation of groundwater during excavation activities by soil freezing, treatment, and discharge to the sanitary sewer; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes a 16-story mixed-use residential apartment community with a below grade garage with structural mat slab foundation.  Excavation of depths from 10-16 feet below existing grade are anticipated for construction of the mat slab.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "LUST Cleanup Site Case No. RO0000058\/T0600101465 – Unocal #6129 was opened in 1989 by ACDEH to evaluate potential impacts to human health and the environment from unauthorized releases from the two 9,800 gallon gasoline USTs, one 550 gallon waste oil UST, and related fuel dispensing system components removed in 1989 during UST system upgrades.    Soil samples were collected from the base of the fuel UST tank pit excavation at a depth of 14 feet bgs (A1, A2, B1, B2), the dispenser\/piping excavations at depths of 3 to 7.5 feet bgs (P1 through P4), and the waste oil UST excavation pit at a depth of 9.5 feet bgs (WO1). All samples were analyzed for TPHg, BTEX and organic lead. In addition the sample collected from the waste oil UST excavation was analyzed for TPHd, total oil &amp; grease, and halogenated volatile organic compounds. Analytical results of the soil samples collected from the fuel UST excavations had maximum concentrations of 10 mg\/kg TPHg, less than 0.05 mg\/kg benzene, less than 0.1 mg\/kg ethylbenzene and toluene, 0.11 mg\/kg xylenes, and 0.058 mg\/kg organic lead. Analytical results of the soil samples collected from the dispenser piping excavation had maximum concentrations of 690 mg\/kg TPHg, 3.2 mg\/kg benzene, 0.36 mg\/kg toluene, less than 0.1 mg\/kg ethylbenzene, and 19 mg\/kg xylenes. The analytical results of the sample collected from the waste oil UST excavation had maximum concentrations of 3.3 mg\/kg TPHd, 58 mg\/kg oil &amp; grease and non-detectable concentrations at good reporting limits for all other constituents. This data indicated unauthorized release(s) from the fuel UST system and waste oil UST had occurred at the site.    Site investigation activities were conducted from 1989 to 2017 to evaluate the extent of subsurface impacts to soil and groundwater from releases(s) from the fuel UST and dispensing system and the waste oil UST.  Site investigation activities included collection of (1) soil samples from borings advanced during installation of monitoring wells (MW1 through MW3), the remedial soil excavation surrounding well MW3 (SW-1 through SW-4 and BT-1 and BT-2), and exploratory bores (EB1 through EB4, SB-1, SB-3 through SB-5, B-2, B-7 through B-10, B-12, and B-14 through B-21); (2) grab groundwater samples from boreholes (B-2, B-7 through B-10, B-12, and B-14 through 16); and (3) groundwater samples from monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-3).  Subsurface lithology was logged using cone penetration testing methodology (CPT-B2, CPT-B4, CPT-B7, CPT- B8, CPT-B10, CPT-B14 and CPT-B-17 through CPT-B-21) adjacent to bores B-2, B-7 through B-10, B-12, B-14, and B-17 through B-21.  Analytical data from soil and groundwater samples indicated that the subsurface beneath the site had been impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons, primarily TPHg, BTEX and MTBE\/TBA.    .In 1989, following removal of the USTs, approximately 1,700 cubic yards of contaminated soil was off-hauled to an appropriate receiving landfill. In 1991, an additional 230 cubic yards of soil was excavated to depths of approximately 6 feet bgs from an area between the dispenser islands and around monitoring well MW-3. No other remediation was conducted at the site.    ACDEH evaluated this UST case for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) and determined that the site qualified for closure as a low risk site to human health and the environment from residual contamination of petroleum hydrocarbons and related fuel constituents in the subsurface. ACDEH’s evaluation determined that the site met all the LTCP General Criteria and the Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater &amp; Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air; however did not meet the Media Specific Criteria for Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Exposure for commercial use due to the lack of analysis of naphthalene and PAHs. The majority of the shallow soil impacts in the 0 to 10 foot interval from the UST system release at the site were excavated during removal of the fuel UST system (UST, dispenser and product piping) and waste oil UST in 1989 and the additional remedial soil excavation conducted in 1991 in the vicinity of the fuel dispensers. Analytical results for 33 samples collected within the 0 to 10 foot interval after remedial excavation was conducted document non-detectable or low concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil with the exception of the area in the vicinity of boring B-7 where TPHg, ethylbenzene and xylenes were detected in soil at 6 feet bgs at concentrations of 220 mg\/kg, 0.46 mg\/kg, and 0.51 mg\/kg in 2006. Therefore, naphthalene and PAHs are not likely to exceed the LTCP media-specific criteria in shallow soil across the majority of the site. Additionally, at the time of case closure evaluation the site was an active fueling station, and therefore any repair or maintenance activity of existing site improvements in areas of residual contamination requires planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures prior to and during excavation activities. ACDEH’s low risk site determination was based on receptors and environmental conditions identified at and in the vicinity of the site at the time of closure and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios, and with the provision that the information provided to ACDEH is accurate and representative of site conditions.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    A bronze foundry operated at 3037 and 3101 Adeline Street from at least 1928 to 1962.  Five soil borings that were advanced at the site on May 1, 2013 detected total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel in soil at concentrations up to 1,600 milligrams per kilogram.  Copper and lead were detected in soil samples at concentrations up to 1,200 and 140 milligrams per kilogram, respectively.  Further site investigation was conducted to define the extent of contamination and to assess possible risks to human health.    Gasoline-, diesel-, and oil-ranged hydrocarbons, naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, copper, and lead residual contamination remain in soil beneath the site and each is above RWQCB ESLs.  The hydrocarbon release appears to be a mid to heavy hydrocarbon feed stock for the former foundry furnace, and limited soil Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) data does not indicate the presence of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, or xylene in soil or groundwater beneath the site.  Petroleum hydrocarbons in the gasoline-range up to 540 mg\/kg, in the diesel-range up to 17,000 mg\/kg, and in the oil-range up to 8,700 mg\/kg, 5.3 naphthalene, 31.0 mg\/kg 2-methylnaphthalene, 1,200 mg\/kg copper, and 650 mg\/kg lead were present in soil beneath the site.    A limited interim remedial action source soil excavation was conducted in September 2016 and successfully removed a core portion of the hydrocarbon and metal contamination which was above commercial Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs).  Residual contamination is present in areas of the site including areas that are not currently accessible.  A Site Management Plan (SMP) was prepared to provide a management structure for handling and managing the residual soil contamination in the event of subsurface excavations, as well for maintaining the Vapor Mitigation System (VMS) which was installed due to the generation of methane during the biodegradation of hydrocarbon contaminants.   In October September 2016 40 tons of contaminated soil was exported under hazardous waste manifests to Kettleman Hills, CA.    Current Land-use at time of Closure  The site consists of three parcels on the west side of Adeline Street.  The northern parcel (5-463-12-1) is occupied by two warehouse buildings.  The center parcel (4-463-34) is occupied by a smaller building and an asphalt paved parking lot, while the southern parcel (4-463-34) is also occupied by the asphalt paved parking lot.  Commercial establishments are located in the three buildings at the site (currently Adeline Scenic Properties, LLC and Dogtown Athletic).    Due to residual contamination, the site was closed with site management requirements that include notifying Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) of a proposed change in land use to any residential or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment or building alteration is proposed that affect or disturb the existing subsurface conditions at the site.    Adjacent Property(ies) Land-use at Time of Closure  Based on data from site investigations, there does not appear to be offsite contamination from former site operations.  Should off-site redevelopment occur, ACDEH recommends evaluating the redevelopment site(s) for chemicals of concern identified on this site.    Historic Land-use \/ Site Investigation  This case was opened in 2014 to address Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), TPH as diesel (TPHd), TPH motor oil (TPHmo), copper, and lead contamination in the vicinity of a former bronze foundry located at the site.  The contamination was discovered due to a property transaction Phase 1 and associated recommendations for a Phase 2 follow up investigation.  Several phases of investigation followed.  Due to residual TPH contamination that extended beneath the smaller southern building, a methane vapor mitigation system consisting of a vapor collection trench was installed immediately adjacent to the south side of the smaller building.  A remedial excavation was additionally conducted and removed a portion of the TPH and metal contamination in an effort to reduce residual contamination at the site.  Due to the remaining residual contamination, a Site Management Plan was generated and a Land Use Covenant (LUC) was entered.  The LUC requires annual inspections and reporting, and communication with ACDEH should site redevelopment, including utility repair (to be protective of the vapor mitigation system), be undertaken.  The annual reports will be uploaded to ACDEH and Geotracker under RO0003257 with the site name.    Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern  The chemicals of concern include TPHg, TPHd, TPHmo, copper, lead, and methane vapor.  Potential exposure routes are, except for methane, direct contact, and inhalation for methane vapor.    Remediation Activities  As noted above, a remedial excavation was additionally conducted and removed a portion of the TPH and metal contamination in an effort to reduce residual contamination at the site.    Case Closure &amp; Future Site Management Requirements   Although the site is not documented to have contained an underground storage tank (UST), this case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  The LTCP states that it is appropriate to apply the policy to other petroleum releases.  Closure of the case under the LTCP for petroleum compounds appears appropriate with a Land Use Covenant (LUC), restricting the contaminated parcels to commercial land use, providing a management structure for handling and managing residual soil contamination in the event of subsurface excavations, and providing procedures for maintaining the Vapor Mitigation System (VMS), which was installed along the south side of the smaller southern building due to the generation of methane during the biodegradation of hydrocarbon contaminants, and periodic reporting.    The non-petroleum contamination was evaluated consistent with criteria described in the Regional Water Board’s Environmental Screening Level Tables, in conjunction with User’s Guide: Derivation and Application of Environmental Screening Levels, revised in March 2016.  Closure of the case appears appropriate with the use of the LUC, restricting the contaminated parcels to commercial land use, providing a management structure for handling and managing residual soil contamination in the event of subsurface excavations, and implementation of institutional and engineering controls consisting of a vapor mitigation system.  Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.”",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently occupied by a one-story warehouse and parking lot.  Surrounding land use is industrial and commercial.  During a Phase I environmental site assessment and limited soil and groundwater investigation in 2004, petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil and groundwater samples collected from boring B8, which was located near the loading dock on the property.  On March 16, 2005, a geophysical survey was conducted in the area of boring B8 and a suspected fill pipe.  The geophysical survey concluded that a UST was present with product lines extending beneath the building between the UST and a former dispenser location inside the building.       The UST and associated piping was removed on August 17, 2005.  The 1,100-gallon UST was rusted and stained with many holes.  The surrounding soil had odors and visible staining.  Four soil samples collected from the excavation contained TPHg and TPHd at concentrations up to 877 ppm and 5,090 ppm, respectively.  An additional soil sample collected from the former dispenser location contained 246 ppm of TPHd and 0.185 ppm of TPHg.     On July 24 and 25 and August 10, 2006, direct push soil borings were advanced to depths of 16 to 24 feet bgs at eleven locations.  Two borings were advanced to 32 feet bgs to assess the vertical extent of contamination.  In addition, the floor of the block building was cored in two locations to collect soil samples from a depth of 4 feet bgs along the product pipeline.  Depth to first encountered groundwater in the borings ranged from 5.5 to 19 feet bgs.  Total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) and benzene were detected in soil samples from the borings at concentrations up to 810 and 3 ppm, respectively.  TPHg and benzene were detected in groundwater samples from the borings at concentrations up to 42,000 and 13,800 ppb, respectively.    Between March 4 and 7, 2007, subsurface soil, soil vapor, and groundwater samples were collected and three monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-3) were installed.  The highest concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were reported in soil boring K-19 and in monitoring well MW-2, both located in the immediate vicinity of the former UST. Elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were also detected in soil and groundwater samples from monitoring well (MW-1) and boring (K-18), located approximately 70 to 90-feet east from the former UST location.    Between January 21 and 31, 2010, five soil borings (K-21 to K-25) were advanced and two additional groundwater monitoring wells (MW-4 and MW-5) were installed to further characterize the vertical and horizontal extent of contamination.  A pilot test was conducted in December 2008 to assess the effectiveness of in situ chemical oxidation to treat petroleum hydrocarbons in the subsurface and obtain design parameters for the potential implementation of full scale chemical oxidation treatment at the site. The pilot test consisted of injecting modified Fenton’s reagent (containing hydrogen peroxide and an iron catalyst) into the subsurface. Using direct push technology, reagent injection was performed at 11 locations in the vicinity of the UST’s former location.  A second round of in-situ chemical oxidation injection was performed between May 27 and June 4, 2009.      Since March 2007, quarterly groundwater monitoring at the site has been conducted in MW-1, MW-2, and MW-3, and since January 2008 monitoring wells MW-4 and MW-5 have also been monitored.

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    In March 1989 four USTs (10,000-gallon diesel, 5,000-gallon diesel, 280-gallon waste oil, and 550-gallon “hydrocarbons”), were removed from the site.   Diesel free phase was observed flowing into the excavation.  In May 1989 19 hand augered soil bores were installed at the site, and 2,400 gallons of free phase and 20,000 gallons of water was removed from the UST excavation.  Approximately 3,000 cubic yards of soil is reported to have been removed in 1989, treated, and stockpiled into a landscape berm between the property and Tidewater Ave.  A 10-inch diameter pipe line was encountered during the excavation, broke, and 3,000 gallons of diesel entered the excavation at that time.  A recovery well with a skimmer pump operated in EW-1 between April and August 1989 but was shut down due to an increased product thickness.  In April 1994 wells MW-1 to MW-3 and bores EB-1 to EB-11 were installed.  In July 1995 bores SB1, SB2, and MW-4 were installed.  In December 2000 soil bores SB-1 to SB-16 were installed.  In February 2001 a CAP was submitted and selected aquifer excavation as most cost effective.  The CAP methodology was approved in February 2001.  In October 2002 a revised CAP was submitted and selected enhanced bio-degradation due to a change in approach and costs; a pilot test was subsequently requested in October 2002 and does not appear to have been conducted.  In February 2006 additional investigation was conducted to gather additional information and bores B-1 to B-15, EW-1 (second), and OB-3 to OB-6 were installed.  A feasibility study (FS) and SCM was submitted in February 2007 and subsequently approved in May 2007.  The FS selected groundwater extraction and treatment and limited source excavation.  In September 2008 bores C-1 to C-16 were installed and a combined site investigation, revised SCM, and RAP was submitted in January 2009.    The CAP was implemented in July 2019, with excavation of 5300 tons of soil excavated (see photos uploaded to GeoTracker). As of May 2022, post remedial groundwater monitoring wells have sampled quarterly since 2020 and shows that the remediation was effective. Case meets LTCP. Next step is the 60-day public notice of intent to issue uniform case closure letter.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "401 High Street: Richfield Oil Company owned the 401 High Street property from 1946 to 1975 and operated a bulk petroleum distribution facility from 1946 to 1967. From 1955 to 1975, American Mineral Spirits Company, Western (AMSCO-W), a joint venture between Richfield Oil Company and Pure Oil Company, operated a bulk terminal for storing, shipping, and receiving chemical products on the property. Pure Oil Company was bought by Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) in 1965. In 1975, Union Oil bought Richfield Oil Company’s share of AMSCO-W. The new entity, Union Chemical Division of Unocal, operated the bulk terminal until 1991. The bulk terminal included a tank farm containing 41 12,000-gallon underground storage tanks (USTs) and 8 aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) for fuels, fuel-related chemicals, and solvents. In 2005, Unocal Corporation merged with Chevron Corporation to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron. A major spill occurred at the northwest edge of the 401 High Street property on July 5, 1983, when 23,300 gallons of toluene was spilled during rail car off-loading at the Unocal tank farm. Unocal estimated that there were between 3,600 and 4,000 gallons of toluene in an undissolved fraction (free phase) in the subsurface, an undetermined portion of which migrated northwest across the property line onto the parcel owned by NEU Investment Corp. and onto the 411 High Street property. In addition, investigations at the 401 High Street property have revealed that soil and groundwater have been impacted by various solvent chemicals and petroleum constituents associated with the former Unocal chemical distribution facility operations. The 401 High Street property was subsequently redeveloped along with 301 High Street (located along High Street) as the existing self-storage facility by the Crist Property Company, and was sold in 2003 to the current owner, Las Vegas II Storage, LLC, now known as Oakland High Street Storage Partners, L.P.",

Five soil bores were installed in August 1989; four were completed as wells (C-1 to C-4).  Wells C-5 to C-7 were installed in August 1990.  Well C-8 was installed in November 1990.  In November 1991 well C-2 was converted to a groundwater extraction well.  In February 1992 the waste oil UST was removed.  In September 1993 wells were surveyed in conjunction with wells at adjacent service stations (Shell and BP, at opposite intersection corners).  In October 1993 the extraction system was turned off due to neighborhood complaints.  In July 1996 well C-9 was installed downgradient. In July 1997 product line trenches were replaced and detectable concentrations were present in soil.  In 1998 a RBCA assessment was conducted, followed by a SCM in 2000.  Residential indoor receptors were identified due to the presence of multiple residential basements in the site vicinity. Well C-10 was installed in August 2003, C-11 and C-12 in February 2015, and C-13 in February 2016.  Soil bores B1 to B7 were also installed in February 2016, vapor wells VP-1 to VP-3 in November 2005, vapor wells VP-4 to VP-6 in February 2015, and VP-7 in November 2017.

The current plans include redeveloping the gas station to commercial shopping.     In 1993, an oil\/water separator was removed.  TPH as motor oil was the only petroleum hydrocarbon detected in soil samples UOW-1 and UOW-2 at a maximum concentration of 170 mg\/kg.      In March 1997 one-280-gallon waste-oil tank, two 12,000-gallon gasoline USTs and product piping were removed.  Overexcavation samples were collected – no initial samples were collected.  Soil samples collected from the waste oil tank excavation were below the detection limit for petroleum hydrocarbons, VOCs and SVOCs.  Soil Samples collected from the gasoline USTs and dispensers contained maximum concentrations of 2.6 mg\/kg TPHg, 0.012 mg\/kg benzene, and 1.4 mg\/kg MTBE.  A water sample obtained from 16 feet in the tank pit contained 6,100 µg\/L TPHg, 54 µg\/L benzene.  No MTBE was detected.      On July 11, 2000, three wells were installed at the site.  Soil boring samples from only MW-1 from 25 feet below grade indicated 19 mg\/kg TPHg and 0.018 mg\/kg benzene.  No MTBE was detected in soil.  The sample was collected in the saturated zone.      The September 12, 2008 Site Conceptual Model (SCM) identified three former USTs (one-5,000 and two-4,000 gallon).  These were identified as one of the remaining data gaps and a subsequent work plan to investigate soil and groundwater in and around the former tanks was subsequently submitted.     October 26, 2009, three borings were advanced, two near the former USTs identified in the SCM and one offsite.  The maximum soil concentrations were 18 ppm TPHg, 2.8 ppm TPHd, and 0.033 ppm MTBE.  No BTEX was detected.  One groundwater sample was obtained during the investigation from the off-site boring.  No petroleum hydrocarbons or oxygenates were detected.      April 6, 2011, two gasoline USTs (one- 15,000 gallon and one 20,000-gallon) were removed by Complete Environmental Solutions and overseen by Tetra Tech and Oakland Fire Department.  The only concentration of hydrocarbons detected in samples collected from the USTs, piping and dispensers was total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel at a concentration of 1.3 mg\/kg.  However, Hydraulic oil and motor oil were detected in soil samples collected from beneath the hoists at maximum concentrations of 32 mg\/kg for each of these constituents at 8 feet below grade.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) provided regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003305 from April 2018 to April 2021 subsequent to referral by the City of Oakland Planning and Building Department.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as automobile service and repair operations with associated former underground storage tanks.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil and soil vapor).  Corrective actions have been completed at the Site including remedial soil excavation and off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air.  The redevelopment of the Site is currently being conducted and includes one mixed-use building approximately 156 feet tall.  The building will generally be at grade, with finished floor elevations approximately matching the surrounding sidewalk grade, with an approximately 40 square foot partial basement level that daylights at the lower driveway level to the adjacent parking garage. The partial basement and first floor of the building will be utilized for retail, residential amenities and building support purposes (i.e. non-residential use).  Residential apartments will be constructed over the first floor.    Cleanup Program Site Case No. RO0003305 was opened by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) in 2018 under a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement with CIM Group to facilitate investigation and cleanup of chemicals of concern in the subsurface associated with historical land use at and in the vicinity of the Site and redevelopment of the site with a mixed-use commercial\/residential building.     The Site was underlain by 1 to 14.5 feet of fill. Chemicals of concern (COCs) detected in subsurface soil\/fill, groundwater, and soil vapor beneath the Site included but were not limited to lead, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), and chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs). Lead and TPH soil impacts were removed during excavation of fill across the Site during redevelopment activities and subsequent offsite investigations delineated the residual dissolved�]phase TPH plume. CVOC impacts in groundwater and soil vapor were identified from off�]site sources.    Site development activities were completed in 2021 and included installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls (VMECs) to mitigate risk to occupants of the building from potential vapor intrusion of soil gas impacted with  CVOCs into indoor air. VMECs installed at the site include: the concrete building foundation (cap); waterproofing\/vapor barrier; trench plugs along utility corridors; and conduit seals to mitigate potential vapor intrusion risks from off�]site vapor impacts including but not limited to tetrachloroethene concentrations detected in the former offsite boring LB�]24 located adjacent south of the Site.    A Risk Management Plan and VMEC Operations and Maintenance Plan have been prepared for the Site and include procedures and instructions associated with long�]term maintenance and repair of VMECs installed at the Site. Strict adherence to the protocols and repair procedures outlined in both documents must be followed in order to adequately protect site occupants and users from exposure to potential residual contamination from new vapor intrusion pathways.    With the provision that the information provided to this agency is accurate and representative of known Site conditions, ACDEH has determined that no further remedial action is required at the Site and therefore closed the case associated with environmental investigation and remediation (RO0003305) and opened a new case (RO0003478) to act as a document repository for long�]term management of the VMECs.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "AB&amp;I has operated on the Site for approximately 77 years. Business activities include the manufacture of cast pipe and fittings. The facility accepts scrap iron and steel, which it stockpiles on-site, and uses during manufacturing activities. The Site encompasses an area of approximately 11.8 acres. The Site contains various warehouses, manufacturing and office buildings. The entire Site is covered with buildings and asphalt and concrete pavement.  The Site is located in a heavy industrial area near the San Leandro Bay within an area identified as the East Bay Plain.     Releases occurred from seven underground storage tanks (USTs) that were previously located on-site. The USTs included one 8,000-gallon UST used for storing unleaded gasoline and one 8,000-gallon UST used for the storage of mineral spirits and later 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA), one 550-gallon UST used for storing regular leaded gasoline, one 10,000-gallon UST used for storing diesel, and three 10,000-gallon USTs used for storing gasoline.    Pilot studies were conducted to address a plume of chlorinated solvents in groundwater in one area of the site and a plume of petroleum hydrocarbons in another area of the site.  The pilot studies consisted of an enhanced aerobic biodegradation study and an enhanced anaerobic biodegradation study.  Groundwater monitoring indicated that the pilot studies were effective in reducing groundwater concentrations.    The site was closed with a Covenant and Environmental Restriction on Property (deed restriction) that limits future land use to industrial.  A Site Management Plan is also place to control potential future exposure to residual contamination.  Please see the Covenant and Environmental Restriciton on Property and Site Management Plan for a description of the residual contamination and the restrictions on future property use.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has been providing regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003347 since March 2019 subsequent to referral by a property transaction.  To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as automobile service and repair operations with associated former underground storage tanks.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil and soil vapor).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include the hazardous material survey and abatement of the existing onsite building and hardscape; demolition of existing Site buildings and above ground infrastructure; remedial soil excavation with consolidation and capping or off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes demolition of the existing buildings and construction of a three-story apartment building that will cover nearly the entire footprint of the Site. The building will include 21 residential units, parking, private open space and other amenities.        Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0003347 was opened by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) in 2019 to provide regulatory oversight of the investigation and cleanup of subsurface contamination at the Site to facilitate redevelopment by 820 Macarthur, LLC. The proposed redevelopment project consists of removal of the existing structures and surface cover and construction of a slab-on-grade multi-story residential building    The Site is located in a mixed residential and commercial area of Oakland and consists of one parcel (Alameda County Assessor Parcel Number (APN) 12-959-9-3) located at the northwest corner of the intersection between West MacArthur Boulevard and West Street.  The Site is bound to the north, west, and northwest by residential single-family homes.  A basement at one of the adjacent residences was observed at approximately 26 inches below ground surface (bgs).  The Site is bound to the east by West Street and to the south by West MacArthur Boulevard.  Commercial businesses are located across the street from West Street and West MacArthur Boulevard, respectively, including an oil change business and an active service station (Former Leaking Underground Storage Tank; LUST Case No RO0000076).  A former LUST Case, Neighborhood Laundry (Case No. RO0000242), is located approximately 185 feet north of the Site.      The Site is currently developed with a vacant commercial building, which formerly operated as an automotive and tire business from approximately 1975 until 2018.  The current site configuration consists of two single-story buildings located on the northwestern and northeastern portions of the property which contain an office and customer waiting room, automotive service bays, a hazardous substance\/waste storage area, and tire and automotive parts storage areas.  Six hydraulic lifts, and a oil-water separator were removed from the site in August 2019.  Based on information provided in a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Report (Phase I), dated August 3, 2018, prepared by Partner Engineering and Science, Inc, the Site was formerly developed in multiple residential configurations including one structure as early as 1897 and 1899, three residences in 1902, six residences and an out building in 1911, and residences and outbuildings from at least 1939 to 1963.  The Site operated as a gasoline service station from at least 1967 to 1975, and as an automotive\/tire service facility since 1975 until 2019.  Tenants on the property included residences (1902-1963), American Oil Company (1967-1970), and Big O Tires (1975-2018).  Historic fuel dispensing systems including two 6,000-gallon, and one 10,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs), and associated fuel dispensers and piping, as well as one 550-gallon waste oil UST, were removed from the site at an unknown date. Hydraulic lifts and an oil water separator were removed from the site in August 2019.    Petroleum related constituents of concern (COCs) and non-petroleum related COCs including chlorinated solvents have been detected at the Site in soil, soil vapor, and groundwater at concentrations above the January 2019 San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Boards (State Water Board) Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs).  Environmental investigations have been conducted at the Site between 2018 and 2020 to delineate the vertical and lateral extent of the petroleum  and chlorinated solvent COCs in the subsurface and evaluate the associated risk to potential on- and off-site sensitive receptors.  Subsurface activites conducted at the Site include but are not limited to: limited exploratory digging to a depth of five feet bgs to evaluate the presence of UST at three historical gasoline UST locations and one waste oil UST location; removal of six hydraulic jacks to evaluate the presence of potential releases of petroleum and\/or non-petroleum COCs; collection of soil samples to evaluate the presence of lead and fill material in shallow soil; installation and sampling of two groundwater monitoring wells (MW1 and MW2) to delineate groundwater impacts; and installation and sampling of soil gas wells to evaluate potential offsite soil gas sources and the extent of soil gas in the vicinity of the Site including TPH-g and methylene chloride impacts downgradient and PCE and chloroform impacts upgradient.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In 1984, the former USTs were removed and three gasoline (6,000-gal, 10-000-gal, &amp; 12,000-gal) and one 10,000-gal diesel UST were installed.  In December 1989, Hunter Environmental Services installed one boring and four GW monitoring wells at Eastmont Mall, which included MW-3 located adjacent to the BP-leased property.  On October 6, 1994, Hydro Environmental Technologies installed 2-inch diameter monitoring wells MW-7, MW-8, and MW-9.  Elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in MW-1 &amp; MW-4 with separate phase hydrocarbons in MW-2.  In August 1998, three gasoline (6,000-gal, 10-000-gal, &amp; 12,000-gal) and one 10,000-gal diesel UST were replaced with three 12,000-gal gasoline and one 10,000-gal diesel UST.  On April 27 and 28, 2000, Cambria completed recovery tests on newly installed wells EX-1, EX-2, and existing well MW-2.  Interim remedial action consisting of short-term GW extraction was conducted.  Approximately 11,000 gallons of water was extracted using a vacuum truck from three wells during 8 site visits.      On October 29 through November 2, 2001, a DPE pilot test was performed using well MW-2 and MW-4 and extraction wells EX-1 and EX-2.  On September 26 and 27, 2005, URS installed 5 onsite soil borings and four off-site borings to depths to delineate groundwater contamination.  Elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were detected at the site. Construction of a DPE system began in late 2007 and included installation of DPE wells DPE-1 through DPE-5, however the system was never started due to difficulties getting power to the site. In 2009, Antea group installed SVE\/AS wells for a pilot test, however prior to implementing the test Antea oversaw  the injection of Plume Stop without regulatory oversight. The Plume Stop injection has apparently mobilized the hydrocarbon mass at the site. GRO and benzene concentrations are indicative of free phase however due to submerged conditions of many of the existing monitoring wells at the site, free phase product may not be detected in the network.    With the loss of the lease in 2014, the USTs were removed, the station demolished, and all but one well of  the monitoring well network destroyed.  Secondary source has been identified in the 15- to 35-foot zone, bgs, in areas associated with the former tank pits and dispenser islands.  Large diameter augering had been proposed for source removal. However, following the delineation of the areas for LDA excavation, the area of excavation was deemed too large to be cost effective.  The 10\/22\/2015 CAP recommends ISCO injection as a more economically feasible remediation alternative. Additional remediation yet to be performed.  Replacement well installation proposed in 11\/2018 work plan for plume delineation reverting back to long screened intervals.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The approximately 0.9-acre Site is located at 3875 Telegraph Avenue in Oakland, California.  Much of the site is covered by a 10,000-square foot building that is surrounded largely by paved parking areas.  The Site is bounded by: 39th Street to the north; Telegraph Avenue to the east; Apgar Street to the south and a parking lot for the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) MacArthur Station to the west.  The surrounding area is a mixed residential and commercial neighborhood.    In the 1930s, the Site was used for two gasoline stations, one in the southwest corner (3855 Telegraph Avenue) and one in the northern portion (3881 Telegraph Avenue) of the Site.  By the 1940s, the two gasoline stations had been removed.  In the 1950s, the southern portion of the Site was occupied by a tamale factory and restaurant; and the northern portion was occupied by another gasoline service station.    In June 1984, as part of pre-construction evaluations, Harding Lawson Associates (HLA) drilled four borings for collection of soil samples for geotechnical testing.  HLA noted the soil cores collected from approximately 15 feet below ground surface contained “gasoline odor.”  In December 1984, the four USTs, associated service station buildings, and pump islands were removed (HLA, 1992).  Following removal of the USTs, the excavation was backfilled with imported material.    In 1984, the Site was purchased by East Bay Outpatient Surgery for development as a surgery center. In May 1985, as part of the surgery center construction, the UST excavation backfill material was removed. The former UST excavation was subsequently over-excavated to a depth of approximately 15 feet below ground surface with approximately 1,070 cubic yards of soil being disposed off-site.    In 2001, Terracon advancing six borings, B-1 to B-6, to a depth of approximately 25-feet below ground surface for the collection of soil and groundwater samples.  In January 2005, Gribi Associates (Gribi) collected 18 soil and 5 groundwater samples from borings advanced offsite within the BART parking lot to the west; and onsite within the southern parking lot. Subsequently, between February 2005 and June 2005, Ninyo &amp; Moore, on behalf of BART, conducted investigations near the Site as part of the MacArthur BART Transit Village redevelopment project (N&amp;M, 2005).  The investigations included the collection of soil and groundwater samples from 27 borings (February 2005) and soil gas samples from 15 borings (June 2005) advanced within: 39th Street; 40th Street; Apgar Street; and the BART parking lot.  The soil and groundwater investigations detected petroleum hydrocarbons both on-site and off-site.  Elevated concentrations of TPH as gasoline (TPHg) have been detected in groundwater samples from temporary boring advanced both on-site and off-site.  A plume of fuel hydrocarbons extends southwest from the Surgery Center to the BART parking lot.  The most recent investigation activities have been conducted in the BART parking lot to define the off-site extent of contamination.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This case was opened by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health in 2017 to investigate subsurface impacts from historic land use (including single family homes, a commercial fueling station, and installation of Bart within a right of way traversing the parcel) and develop a corrective action plan necessary to facilitate a property transaction and redevelopment of the site and an adjacent parcel, to mixed use.The commercial gas station was demolished in 2019 and the following corrective actions have been completed at the site: (1) remediation of soil and groundwater using multi-phase extraction followed by an evaluation of rebound conditions, (2) excavation of petroleum hydrocarbon impacted soil, and (3) partial excavation of soil containing lead concentrations above residential environmental screening levels. The case was closed by ACDEH in February 2020, based on information in the case file and with the provision that the information provided to ACDEH is accurate and representative of site conditions. ACDEH’s closure determination was based on an analysis of risk to human health and the environment under the land use scenario as a vacant lot at the time of case closure. Risk to receptors under different land use scenarios or site configurations, were not considered in the closure determination of this SCP case.     Additional excavation of lead impacted soil on the subject site is proposed in a corrective action plan prepared for a mixed-use redevelopment project located at both the 2200 Telegraph Avenue site and the 2201 Valley Street. Regulatory oversight of excavation of lead impacted soil on the parcel will be conducted under a Separate Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO3380 concurrent with site redevelopment activities that are expected to commence in June 2020.",

The tank was located beneath the sidewalk on the north side of 2nd Street.  The tank was found to be in poor condition with visible holes. Soil discoloration and hydrocarbon odors were observed in the tank excavation. Soil observed during the UST removal was predominantly clay. No groundwater was observed in the excavation during the tank removal process performed in October 29, 2020.  Maximum soil concentrations associated with the UST removal were reported at 500 mg\/kg TPHg, 1,200 mg\/kg TPHd, 5.0 mg\/kg Naphthalene &amp; 100 mg\/kg lead (Pb).  On November 19, 2020, approximately 110 feet of piping and a dispenser island were removed.  Maximum soil concentrations associated with the piping and dispenser island removal were reported at 2,800 mg\/kg TPHg, 1,100 mg\/kg TPHd, 5.0 mg\/kg &amp; 670 mg\/kg Pb.  These concentrations indicate a release from the UST fueling system has occurred.  The tank excavation was backfilled using sand slurry on November 23, 2020.  The piping trench was backfilled with clean imported material on December 11, 2020 and area was restored to its original condition.",

On August  16,1989 two 10,000-gallon gasoline, one 280-gallon waste oil UST and product piping were replaced at the site.  Visible soil contamination was observed and an unauthorized release form was filed on August 31,1989 resulting in case opening.  350 cu yds of soil and 6,500 gallons of groundwater removed from the tank pit.  Monitoring wells subsequently installed at the site and free product was observed.  Subsequent recovery efforts and further delineation have been conducted to date.  1993 pilot VES test performed and deemed unsuitable.   Dispensers and piping were replaced in February,1998 with an additional 30.20 tons of impacted soil removed for off-site disposal.   2005 DPE test was determined to be a viable remedial option but not implemented.     Elevated soil and soil vapor data indicate unweathered LNAPL is present in the southeast corner of the site along the property line to the downgradient adjacent property. Boring logs for the vapor probes installed on and off-site indicate a permeable layer (gravel and sand) between 0 and 5 feet below ground surface that was not previously unidentified in other boring logs generated for site. The lateral extent of the permeably layer and potential vapor migration and perched groundwater impacts have defined or evaluated. Additional characterization of the shallow impacts and corrective action is required to be implemented to reduce potential risk to off-site receptors and advance the case to closure.",

Furthermore, the LUST evaluation was limited to evaluation of risks to receptors under the existing land use, which was (at the time) industrial. The LUST case was closed in 2011 with the caveats that the closure was relative to petroleum related constituents only and that the closure was valid under the land use at the time of closure only (industrial use).    This is a former CalTrans maintenance station that was redeveloped into the former Epic Middle School. This redevelopment was conducted without environmental regulatory oversight. CalTrans is currently in the process of transferring the property to Education for Change and a seperate Site Cleanup Program case (RO0003432) has been opened to provide environmental regulatory oversight of the Site as it is developed for use as a school with Education for Change accepting the role as lead responsible party. Upon completion of the property transfer, the Site Cleanup Program case associated with CalTrans will be closed and all further regulatory oversight action will be completed under the Education for Change Site Cleanup Program case.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is approximately 35,000 square feet (0.82-acres) in size and is situated to the northeast of the intersection at Coliseum Way and 45th Avenue  on Alameda County Assessor Parcel Numbers (34-2290-4-1, 34-2290-3-1, and 34-2290-2-1). Redevelopment of the Site is proposed for development of a five-story, commercial self-storage building constructed on a slab-on-grade foundation; construction activities include the demolition of flatwork and the excavation and grading of existing fill material at the Site.     Site environmental investigations have been advanced at the Site to support characterization of the Site prior to planned redevelopment.      Based on Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, multiple historical Site configurations included the following:  - The 1897 Sanborn map depicts a Magazine building in the southeast corner of the Site, a \"Varnish Ho\" with \"Kettles\" identified in the central and southcentral portions of the Site, and two \"W. Ho\" (warehouse) structures located in the northwestern portion of the Site.   - By 1912, the Site is depicted as vacant and undeveloped on the Sanborn map.   - Historical on-Site operations since at least 1925 have included sandblasting, cabinetry, furniture refinishing, paint studios, sign manufacturing, auto body repair, welding and iron works, plumbing, upholstery services, machine shops, and residential use.    Environmental investigations for due diligence were performed by the project proponent in August and November 2020. In August 2020, a total of 40 soil samples were collected from eight locations at the Site in one foot increments up to five feet below the existing grade; analysis included the following:  - 40 samples were analyzed at a State of California certified analytical laboratory for total lead by United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) test Method 6010B.   - Two soil samples from each boring (total of 16) were analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by US EPA test Method 8260B, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) by US EPA test Method 8015B, semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) by US EPA test Method 8070C, and Title 22 Metals by US EPA test Method 6010B\/7174.  Additional shallow soil and soil gas sampling was completed at the Site on November 20, 2020. During the sampling activities, nine additional borings were advanced at the Site to five feet below grade and six step-out borings were advanced to three feet below grade; analysis included the following:   - Select soil samples were analyzed for total lead, asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by US EPA test method 8082A.   - Nine of the soil borings were converted to permanent soil vapor probes at a depth of 5 feet below existing grade and analyzed for VOCs and TPHg by test method TO-15.      Based on the results of sampling and analysis, residual metals, TPH, and Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds (SVOCs) have been detected in relatively shallow undocumented fill material. For metals, lead in considered to be the primary element of concern, with fourteen of the seventy total soil samples analyzed for lead exceeding the construction worker ESL of 160 mg\/kg. On this basis, lead has been determined to be the primary chemical of concern in shallow soil at the Site.     Soil gas samples collected from the nine soil gas probes at the Site indicated TPH-g, benzene, ethylbenzene, and methylene chloride were reported at concentrations exceeding their respective commercial ESLs at concentrations of 820,000; 80; 380; and 2,100 micrograms per cubic meter, respectively. The chlorinated VOC tetrachloroethene was also detected at a maximum concentration of 25 micrograms per cubic meter and was non-detectable in one sample at an elevated reporting limit of 270 micrograms per cubic meter.    A Grading Sequencing Plan has been developed to outline the procedures for excavating areas of soil impacted with lead at concentrations above the construction worker San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board's Environmental Screening Level (ESL) of 160 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) and consolidate this impacted soil at the bottom of the excavation footprint. The lead impacted soil will then be recompacted, covered with a Geotextile delineation marker fabric, topped with remaining soil from the Site, and capped with a 4 inch gravel base and 14 inch mat slab. Soil management protocols during construction will be carried out under a Soil and Groundwater Management Plan (SGMP).Real-time air monitoring for respirable dust will be performed during excavation and handling of lead-impacted soil at the Site.    Based on the soil gas analytical data obtained during the recent assessment work, a vapor intrusion mitigation system will be designed and installed at the Site as part of the planned construction.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site is an active container terminal operated by the Port of Oakland and consists of the the areas formerly occupied by the Kaiser Steel Corporation (Kaiser) and the Powerine Oil Company (Powerine) facilities,  The location of these adjacent facilities were bounded by the former 7th Street on the north and west, the Oakland Inner Harbor  to the southwest, the Oakland Naval Supply Center to the southeast and, on the east, the extension of former Terminal Street south of 7th Street. with Kaiser on the west side of Powerine.   In the early 1990s, 7th Street was realigned and Terminal Street eliminated as part of Port Berth 30 redevelopment activities.      The case was opened following contamination having been encountered during the removal of three USTs- 2 gasoline (capacities of 5,000 and 3,000-gallon) and one 5,000-gallon diesel-  in April 1992 from the Kaiser portion of the site.  Up to 1\/4-inch of free product was observed on excavation pit water.  Tank contents totaling approximately 900 gallons were pumped from the UST pit.  A 4th UST, of 2,500 gallon capacity, was encountered in August 1992 on the Kaiser portion of the site during port redevelopment activities.  Numerous holes were observed in the riveted steel tank.  400 gallons of liquid was removed from the UST.  Samples were analyzed for TPHg\/d, TOG, HVOCs x8010, PCBs x8080, &amp; base\/neutral\/acid (BNA) extractable by x8270 and LUFT metals.  Concentrations of TPHg, BTEX or TPHd; HVOCs, PCBs, or B\/N\/A were documented below the respective laboratory reporting limits.  With the exception of Zn at 460 mg\/kg, LUFT metals were reported at background concentrations.  Additionally, concentrations of TOG were reported up to 90 mg\/kg.      TPH-contaminated soil was encountered during pre-grading activities conducted in November 1992 in the Powerine portion of the site during removal of a concrete slab.  Product conveyance piping was encountered during excavation of the contaminated soil. A contaminant delineation investigation was performed to define the excavation limits.  Approximately 2,300 cu. yds. of soil was excavated in November 1992 and removed for off-site treatment.      A site investigation was conducted in 2016 consisting of advancing seven bores for the collection of soil and grab-groundwater (GGW)  samples. Samples were analyzed for TPHg\/d, BTEX, MTBE and naphthalene.  Maximum soil concentrations of TPHd were reported at 100 mg\/kg and naphthalene concentrations reported in one sample at 1.1 mg\/kg.   TPHg, BTEX and MTBE were documented at concentrations below the reporting limit.  GGW samples were reported to contain up to 1,400 ug\/L TPHd and 88 ug\/L TPHg.  Toluene was reported in one GGW sample at a concentration of 8.5 ug\/L.  Naphthalene, BEX and MTBE were documented at concentrations below the reporting limit.  However, naphthalene was documented to have elevated reporting limits in three samples of up to 1,500 ug\/L.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is currently operated by an independent gasoline station operator but was formerly ConocoPhillips.  The current site owner purchased the USTs currently in place along with the property.     Fuel leak case RO528 was closed on 4\/20\/1994 for the ConocoPhillips service station.  That closure was for the USTs removed on 11\/22\/1989 and replaced with the USTs currently present at the site (in the same location) which are not part of this closure.      On September 27, 2007, ATC advanced three soil borings for a property transaction, ATC-2, ATC, 4 and ATC-5.  Soil samples contained maximum concentrations of 5.2 ppm TPHg in ATC- 5 from 5 feet below ground surface (bgs).  Grab groundwater samples detected up to 25,000 ppb TPHd and 5,300 ppb TPHg in boring ATC-2.  (No diesel tanks were reported to have been on-site.)  The soil sample from ATC04 contained methylene chloride at 0.007ppm but no petroleum hydrocarbons.  No groundwater sample was collected from ATC-4.    December 1, through 10, 2010 – Antea Group oversaw Cascade Drilling install monitoring wells MW-1, MW-2 and MW-3, advance 3 soil borings and attempt one CPT boring.  Monitoring well MW-1 was placed adjacent to former boring ATC-2.  The maximum concentration was 447 ppm Diesel Range Organics (DRO) in MW-2 from 7.5 to 8 feet bgs.  No gasoline range organics (GRO), BTEX or oxygenates were detected in soil.  Groundwater from the monitoring wells had maximum detections of 119 ppb GRO, 74.4 ppb DRO and 2.5 ppb MTBE.       December 2010 – August 2011 – Quarterly groundwater monitoring was performed at site for four quarters.  Maximum concentrations of 119 ppb GRO, 74.4 ppb DRO and 2.5 ppb MTBE were reported from groundwater in the wells.  Contaminant concentrations in groundwater have reduced over the four quarters of monitoring to levels stated above.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "CURRENT STATUS    Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) opened Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0003418 in April 2020 based on a review of draft data submitted for the soil, soil vapor and groundwater investigations conducted in 2019 and 2020 that indicate an on-Site source of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and benzene and a potential off-site source of TCE in groundwater migrating beneath the site. This determination was based on the following:    • The highest detections of PCE in the dataset are in the soil vapor sample collected from probe SV-6 (PCE = 770 ug\/m3) and the grab groundwater sample from soil boring SB-9 (PCE = 19 ug\/l). These concentrations exceed the  San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board’s 2019 Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) for soil vapor and groundwater vapor intrusion risk at commercial sites are 67 ug\/m3 and 2.8 ug\/l, respectively.     • The soil vapor samples collected within and adjacent to the proposed building footprint indicate elevated levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including but not limited to benzene that may be to be associated with the fill material placed in this location to build the pad for the proposed building.      On April 22, 2020 ACDEH requested the Responsible Party to complete the following tasks:    -Claim the case in the State Water Resources Control Board’s Geotracker database and upload all environmental information related to the subject site to the Geotracker case file including but not limited to Phase 1 Environmental Assessments and investigation reports, and analytical laboratory data and water level data in electronic deliverable format (edf) by May 6, 2020.  -Conduct the sewer vapor sampling activities from the sewer cleanouts located on the site by May 1, 2020.  -Execute a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement (VRAA) with ACDEH to provide regulatory oversight of the case by May 8, 2020  -Submit a Site Investigation Report documenting the November 2019 and 2020 site investigation activities by May 15, 2020    -Schedule a meeting with ACDEH to discuss the path forward for obtaining clearance for the proposed warehouse and conducting additional investigation activities at the site by May 8, 2020.    SITE HISTORY    Site is an active trucking facility providing warehousing and distribution services.  R&amp;A specializes in handling bulk processed metals such as coiled steel &amp; aluminum.  Site entirely hardscaped with pavement or concrete.  DTW is reported at 7 feet bgs.  A previous owner- Safeway- is reported to have manufactured soap on the property and operated several vertically-oriented AGTs and a fuel UST.  Petroleum hydrocarbons, including TPHd and BTEX compounds, and chlorinated VOCs, including PCE, TCE and chloroform, have been identified in groundwater and\/or soil vapor at the site.  Investigations at this site are in the preliminary phase for characterization.    The current property owner has plans to construct a new one-story, 39,000-square-foot material storage warehouse on the northern half of the 1100 77th Avenue parcel  (Figure 1-2). The storage warehouse will be constructed over a slab-on-grade foundation that will be eight inches thick. The building will be of steel-framed construction with steel siding and rooftop. The building will measure approximately 34.5 feet high, 300 feet long, and 135 feet wide. No offices, bathrooms, or other interior working spaces are planned as part of this development.  The proposed building will be constructed over an existing building pad. The building pad was laid in 2019 and is comprised of crushed concrete and brick generated from the demolition of the building formerly located in this area. Minimal grading or soil excavation activities are anticipated for this Project and groundwater is not expected to be encountered.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "For several years, the RO0000010 and RO0000187 case files were separately maintained, but contained the same set of data.  Since  the cases deal with different  locations on the same site, a decision was made to administratively closed RO0000187 and incorporate it to RO0000010 in order to eliminate the duplication of effort, ACDEH case file RO0000187 was administratively closed with out public participation or issuance of a RAC on March 17, 2017.  Any reports and data related to ACDEH case file RO0000187 after March 17, 2017 will be found in the RO0000010 case file.      Two adjacent LUST facilities operated at the Port of Oakland along Seventh Street.  One facility, identified as Port of Oakland, was occupied by Building C-401, addressed as 2227 Seventh Street.  The second facility, identified as Port of Oakland \/ Nation’s Way Transport, was occupied by Buildings C-406 and C-407 and were addressed as 2225 Seventh Street.        The 2227 Seventh Street property was occupied by four USTs were removed on September 23, 1993.  Free phase product was observed floating on tank pit groundwater, resulting in Alameda County Environmental Health (ACEH) opening case file number RO0000010.    The 2225 Seventh Street property was occupied by nine USTs, which were removed between March 1990 and August 1992.  Free phase product was observed floating on tank pit groundwater, resulting in Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) opening case file number RO0000187.     The Port of Oakland demolished the structures on both properties during port redevelopment, resulting in re-addressing the site as 651 Maritime Street and making it difficult to distinguish between the 2225 and 2227 Seventh Street facilities.    For several years, the RO0000010 and RO0000187 case files were separately maintained, but contained the same set of data.  In order to eliminate the duplication of effort, ACDEH case file RO0000187 has been made inactive as of 1\/01\/2015.  Any reports and data related to ACDEH case file RO0000187 after 1\/01\/2015 will be found in the RO0000010 case file.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at https:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The site contained nine USTs at 2255 Seventh St: 5x 20k-gal and 1x10k-gal diesel, 1x8k-gal gasoline, 1x6k-gal oil, and 1x2k-gal waste oil.  the 10k-gal diesel UST failed a 1989  pressure test and was removed in July 1991.  The  5x 20k-gal diesel, 1x8k-gal gasoline, and 1x6k-gal oil USTs were removed on  7\/27\/1992.  Free product was noted floating on groundwater infiltraing into the tank pit.  The 2k-gal waste oil was removed on 8\/18\/1992.  A sheen was observed on groundwater infiltraing into the tank pit.      Vacuum applied to FP recovery system on 7\/31\/2006 with premature FP removal discontinued on 6\/07\/2011 and increased TPH concentrations observed in wells, including down-gradient site boundary well MW-4, for one year following ceasing FP removal.  Plume may be stabilized or decreasing; however, well screens for some wells always submerged and occasionally true for several other MWs.      Well network delineating plume not old enough for 5-yrs of data, O2 measurements indicate much of the site is &gt;4%. Methane generation from plume biodegradation is problematic for closure.  170,000 ug\/M3 benzene reported in soil gas.      Though metals include 880 mg\/kg As, 680 mg\/kg Pb and 600 mg\/kg Zn, site is capped and an SMP is in place.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    In early to mid-2001, a substantial site investigation was conducted under DTSC oversight for the potential redevelopment of the parcels, and additional parcels not a part of this case, into a school site.  This included one additional parcel to the west of the nine current parcels of interest, and a number of parcels to the north of 105th Avenue.  That redevelopment did not occur.    An earlier site cleanup program case (RO0002964) was opened in 2007 and closed in April 2014 in association with a previously proposed redevelopment that was not constructed.    In early to mid-2015 an additional investigation (RO0003151) was conducted to facilitate the remedial excavation of five areas of concern identified by the DTSC investigations.  Addresses subject to that investigation and closure include 1424 (APN 47-5509-10), 1500 - 1510 (APN 47-5509-9-1), 1520 (APN 47-5509-7), 1528 (APN 47-5509-6) 1536 - 1538 (APN 47-5509-5), 1544 (APN 47-5509-4), 1548 - 1550 (APN 47-5509-3), and 1560 \/ 1570 (APN 47-5509-1-1) 105th Avenue, and 10550 International Blvd. (APN 47-5509-5-2).  The closure for 10500 International Blvd (APN 47-5509-41) remains associated with case RO0000966 or T0600101676; that closure has not been superseded by another closure as of August 2015.  RO0003151 was closed in August 2015 after remedial excavations had been conducted and documented.    This case (RO0003191) was opened in November 2015 in the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health Site Cleanup Program to evaluate the nine parcels referenced above for potential unrestricted residential land use, with one parcel to remain commercial (a total of ten parcels) located at 10500 International Blvd (the intersection of 105th Avenue and International Blvd.)  Land use at the parcels has historically been both commercial and residential.    For the subject redevelopment, it is reported that the parcel associated with 10500 International Blvd. will remain commercial and that occupancy will not include sensitive populations.  It is also reported that the front portion of the parcel associated with 10550 International Blvd will remain commercial; however, the majority of the parcel is proposed to be converted to residential land use.  The eight other parcels along 105th Avenue are proposed to be converted to residential land use.    This case (RO0003191) was closed administratively in April 2017 as the proposed redevelopment did not proceed further.  Therefore, land use restrictions applied to the parcels in association with the closure of case RO00003151 remain unaltered, except for parcel 47-5509-41, which remains as it was applied at the time of closure of RO0000966.",

Two 10,000-gallon gasoline, one 5,000-gallon gasoline, and one 1,000-gallon waste oil USTs; two hydraulic hoists, and two dispenser islands are reported to have been present.  No environmental samples were collected at the time.  In March 1988 the currently existing warehouse was under construction and geotechnical bores B-1 to B-3 were installed and encountered gasoline odors.  In August 1988 well VH-1 was installed.  In February 1993 wells MW-2 and MW-3 were installed.  Well MW-4 and soil bore SB-1 were installed in August 1995.  Hand auger bores HA-1 to HA-3 and soil bores GP-1 to GP-3 were installed in March 2002.  Soil bores SB-2 to SB-4 and vapor probes VP-1 to V-4 were installed in May 2008.    The downgradient and vertical extent of soil and groundwater contamination does not appear to be defined except in the shallow groundwater zone.  The release appears to have occurred in a period of lower groundwater, as the highest PID detections in bore logs (MW-2, GP-1, B-2) are below groundwater at a depth of approximately 15 feet.  The significance of these PID detections is unknown as all deep soil samples with elevated PID detections (significantly higher than shallow soil PID detections) were not analyzed.  It is also unknown if chlorinated solvents may play a role in these elevated PID results at depth.  Removal of secondary sources (UST backfill) is unconfirmed as the tank removals were in 1976.  The distance to water supply wells is also unknown.  A 1993 well survey was conducted; however, the installation of new water supply wells in the interim is a distinct possibility in this area of Oakland.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is the location of an inter-modal freight shipping center associated with the Port of Oakland container terminal.  The site, previously overseen by ACDEH, was transferred to the RWQCB and transferred back to the ACDEH in January 2019.  During the RWQCB years, site redevelopment which included the removal and replacement of the monitoring well network and installation of slurry walls  to impede and redirect groundwater flow.   The replacement well network exceeded the boundaries for the current case.  A meeting will be scheduled in 2019 to discuss the status of the cases, redevelopment and status of groundwater network.    USTs removed in 1987 and 1990.  Monitoring wells and a product recovery well installed in 1993.  Recovered free product from 1993 to 1999.  Free product still at the site.  Sometime in 2001, monitoring well decommissioning was approved due to pending site redevelopment.  To date the replacement monitoring wells, a condition of the prior well decommissioning, have not been re-installed.  As of 7\/21\/2011he Port has not implemented the approved CAP.    Evaluation of the State Water Resources Control Board’s (SWRCBs) Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (LTCP):   The site does not meet the General Criteria sections b, d, e, and f as:  The unauthorized release does not consist only of petroleum.  Arsenic has been reported at concentrations up to 42 mg\/kg and lead to 3,890 mg\/kg.  It is unclear if the SVOCs present at the site are a result of releases associated with the UST complex; free product was reported at the site at the time of the well decommissioning; however, current presence of free product is not known.  At the time of decommissioning free product had not been removed to the extent practicable; the Site Conceptual Model is inadequate as soil contamination not adequately defined, groundwater contaminate plume has not been delineated, and sensitive receptors have not been identified.     The site fails the Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater as:  The plume length has not been established and may comingle with the plume associated with the adjacent Port of Oakland\/ Union Pacific Railroad site.  The comingled contaminant plume daylights at the Oakland Estuary with TPHd having exceeded Estuary ESLs at the estuary margin; free product had previously been reported at the site; however, current presence of free product is not known. it is not known if the plume is stable or decreasing;  or if recoverable free product remains in groundwater; free product had previously been reported at the site and the plume is not defined and may extend off-site; benzene and MTBE had previously been reported at the site; however, current concentrations are not known.locations of supply wells in the vicinity of the site has not been evaluated.  Hence, the distance of the contaminant plume to nearby wells cannot be determined.  the Oakland Estuary is less than 250 feet down gradient of the release.     The site fails the Media Specific Criteria for Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air as TPH in the upper 10 exceeds 100 mg\/kg with a bioattenuation zone of 5- to 10 feet, and no soil gas sampling has been conducted.    ACDEH was the case lead.  The SF Regional Board assumed case lead during the Port of Oakland redevelopment project.  Though SFRB is documented to have transferred the case back to ACDEH in 2006, the SFRB retained control of the case until early 2019.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In January 1987, petrleum hydrocarbon contamination was discovered during excavation and removal of a waste-oil UST and 3 gasloine USTs. Operation of a groundwater extraction system began on January 25, 1993. The system was shut down on May 9, 1995 due to low concentration\/removal rates. A No further Action leter was issued by ACEh on July 11, 1997.     No additional environmental work was conducted at the site until product line removal and upgrade construction activities in October and November 2002, at which time elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil and groundwater samples.   In 2007, a soil and groundwater investigation was conducted at the site.  In 2008, three monitoring well pairs were installed at the site.  The site was evaluated for case closure under the State Water Resources Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy.  Based upon the information available in our files to date, no further investigation or cleanup for the fuel leak case is necessary at this time.      Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site Cleanup Case No. RO00003151 was opened  under an Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement to evaluate a site consisting of nine parcels for potential residential redevelopment.  This case was closed  when the redevelopment project was withdrawn. There are two other historic closed cases associated with this site: Site Cleanup Case No. RO0002964 and Fuel Leak Case No. RO0000966.    Motor oil contaminants are documented to be present beneath the site at four locations at concentrations above RWQCB ESLs for TPH as motor oil (taste, odor and solubility) of 100 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg); however, are significantly below the direct contact ESL of 100,000 mg\/kg.  The locations appear to be limited in extent and depth and the concentrations do not represent a significant environmental concern for the site.      If a change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, Alameda County Environmental Health (ACEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.     Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    Historic Land Use    Land use at the site historically has been both commercial and residential. In early to mid 2001, a substantial site investigation was conducted under DTSC oversight for the potential redevelopment of the parcels, and additional parcels not a part of this case, into a school site.  This included one additional parcel to the west of the nine current parcels of interest, and a number of parcels to the north of 105th Avenue.  That redevelopment did not occur.    An earlier Site Cleanup Program case (RO0002964) was opened and closed in association with a previously proposed redevelopment that was also not constructed.    In early to mid  2015 an additional investigation was conducted in conjunction with the remedial excavation of five areas of concern.  Addresses subject to this closure include 1424 (APN 47-5509-10), 1500 - 1510 (APN 47-5509-9-1), 1520 (APN 47-5509-7), 1528 (APN 47-5509-6) 1536 - 1538 (APN 47-5509-5), 1544 (APN 47-5509-4), 1548 - 1550 (APN 47-5509-3), and 1560 \/ 1570 (APN 47-5509-1-1) 105th Avenue, and 10550 International Blvd. (APN 47-5509-5-2).  10500 International Blvd (APN 47-5509-41) is specifically associated with case RO0000966 or T0600101676; that closure has not been superseded by another closure as of August 2015.

Both sites have been investigated, remediated and mitigated.Contaminants of concern including slag and slag-impacted soil, along with low levels of petroleum hydrocarbons, semi-volatile organic compounds, and chlorinated solvents have been identified and adequately characterized in soil, soil gas, and groundwater. The source of the slag contaminants is not definitive and could be from former industrial steel manufacturing facilities in the site vicinity. The sources of the non-slag pollutants were surface releases from prior boat maintenance activities from the Cryer Boatyard parcel and prior industrial activities at the Steamvalve parcel The City of Oakland (City) excavated approximately 4,990 tons of California and RCRA hazardous waste to a maximum depth of 5 feet below surface grade, covered the excavated surface with orange fencing with geotextile stamped with hazard warning, and capped the excavated areas with concrete or asphalt surfaces or at least two feet of clean fill. The Regional Water Board’s January 11, 2011, letter approved the City of Oakland’s (City’s) November 12, 2010, Remediation Completion Report. Groundwater and soil gas contaminant concentrations were below State Maximum Contaminant Levels or the applicable ESL and required no remediation. On March 15, 2011, the City recorded the deed restriction at the site to prohibit sensitive land uses and posted a warning sign to stay off the Beach Area of the site.     The Port of Oakland Embarcadero Case #01S0060 has been investigated, remediated, mitigated and redeveloped in conjunction with former Cryer Site (aka Cryer-Steamvalve) which was closed March 30, 2011.

This case was opened in approximately 1994 due to the submittal of a report documenting a surficial soil sampling event in June 1988 for a proposed redevelopment project which indicated historic rail spur contamination to be present in near surface soil at the site.   Subsequently, the site was subdivided into six smaller parcels and each redeveloped (34-2300-19, 34-2300-20,34-2300-21, 34-2300-22, 34-2300-23, and 34-2300-24) .  In 2015, a separate environmental case (Tidewater Subsite; RO0003177, Global Id T10000007146, for parcel 34-2300-19) was opened to allow the investigation of the historic contamination which was now located on that parcel.    Additionally a fragment of an underground storage tank (UST) removal report was mistakenly associated with this case due to an address associated with a consultant tenant at the site.  This misinformation has also been resolved.  This data remains only on the ACDEH website.    This case has been administratively closed as there is no documentation of contamination on the five parcels associated with this site.",

This case was opened in 2014 following the removal of an underground storage tank 1,000 gallon underground storage tank (UST) from beneath the sidewalk along 15th Street.  The UST, a 1,000-gallon tank and appurtenant piping, was removed in December 2013.  The UST historically contained gasoline.  During tank excavation, reported concentrations included up to 906 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), 15.1 mg\/kg toluene, 27.2 mg\/kg ethylbenzene, 222 mg\/kg total xylenes, 20.1 mg\/kg naphthalene, and 0.560 mg\/kg methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) were detected in soil taken from beneath the UST at a depth of eight (8) feet below ground surface.    ACDEH requests work plan in letters dated January 26, 2015 and June 15, 2015.  ACDEH has not received any correspondence from RP until receipt of the January 25, 2016 document entitled Well Installation and Interim Remedial Corrective Action Report, documenting well installation, well sampling, operation of a groundwater pump &amp; treat system, and well destruction.  ACDEH requested a meeting to discuss clean up actions.    Meeting held on 4\/21\/2016  with RP and consultant.  ACDEH stated the site is an open case under the regulatory oversight of the ACDEH and that the work performed at this site was not performed with the knowledge or approval of a regulatory oversight agency.  ACEH reviewed the data presented at the meeting.  It was apparent that neither the ACDEH ftp nor SWRCB GeoTracker websites contained all the documents discussed at the meeting, including a Phase I\/ Phase II document dated from 2013.  ACDEH requested the submittal of the document and all other environmentally-related documents not currently present on the websites.  ACDEH also requested the upload of supporting documentation for all GeoTracker submittals.  The missing submittals were presented at the meeting.  Additionally, ACDEH would prepared a letter requesting a Site Summary Report with condensed tables and updated figures and would request ESI submittals and would provide a listing of the GeoTracker supporting documentation not present on the website.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The site is currently a Super Stop service station that dispenses gasoline.  The property has been occupied by a service station since approximately 1968 and was previously equipped with hydraulic hoists, an oil-water clarifier, and a waste oil underground storage tank (UST). Land use in the area is mixed commercial, residential, and transportation.    Seven shallow soil samples (A through F and SS-1) were collected from the site on December 14, 1989 during the removal and replacement of product piping.  Contamination was detected in two soil samples (B and SS-1) up to 1,700 parts per million (ppm) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) and 0.14 ppm benzene.    Three groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 through 3) were installed at the site in response to a suspected leak in 1983.  Soil samples were not collected from the well borings, nor was there any groundwater samples collected.  The depth to groundwater was measured in well MW-1, MW-2, and MW-3 as 10.35, 10.50 and, 11.58 feet below ground surface (bgs), respectively.  On March 6, 1990, the well caps were replaced due to corrosion and possible leakage.  On March 13, 1990 groundwater samples were collected from the three wells and up to 50,000 parts per billion (ppb) TPHg (MW-1) and 9,900 ppb benzene (MW-3) were detected.    On October 18, 1990, monitoring wells MW-4 to MW-6 were installed to a depth of 20 to 25 feet bgs.  Soil samples were collected from the borings at depths of 10.5, 15.5, and\/or 30.5 feet bgs.  TPHg was the only constituent analyzed and was detected up to 190 ppm in the samples collected from boring MW-5.  Groundwater samples were collected from the wells on October 31, 1990 and contained up to 100 ppb TPHg and 3 ppb xylenes.  Using the depth to groundwater measurements collected from three wells March 1990, the groundwater gradient had been estimated to be towards the south southwest.  However, using depth to water measurements collected from five wells in November 1990, the groundwater gradient was determined to be towards the west northwest.  Therefore, monitoring wells MW-5 and MW-6, thought to have been installed downgradient of the site were upgradient.  Groundwater concentrations from MW-5 and MW-6 have predominately contained very low detections of petroleum hydrocarbons through time.    During the October 10, 1992 groundwater monitoring event, light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) was observed in well MW-3 at a measured thickness of 0.24 feet.  A groundwater sample was collected and detected a concentration of 14,000,000 ppb TPH gasoline and 12,000 ppb benzene.  A weekly bailing program was implemented between November and December 1992 to remove the observed LNAPL, during which time approximately 270 milliliters of LNAPL are reported to have been removed.    In February 1994, groundwater monitoring wells MW-7 and MW-8 were installed to a depth of 20 feet bgs.  Two soil samples were collected from each boring.  There were no detectable concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil samples.  Groundwater was first sampled from wells MW-7 and MW-8 on March 8, 1994 and up to 28,000 ppb TPHg and 2,900 ppb benzene were detected.    On April 17, 1995, one 1,000-gallon waste oil UST was removed from the western portion of site.  The UST appeared to be in good repair upon removal; no holes were observed.  Soil samples were collected from soil stockpiled and walls of the excavation at depths of 10.5 of 11 feet bgs.  Groundwater was observed in the tank pit at 13 feet bgs.  Analysis of the soil samples detected up to 75 ppm Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd), 2,700 ppm Total Recoverable Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TRPH); no detectable concentrations of chlorinated solvents, naphthalene or other polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in tank excavation bottom confirmation samples collected at a depth of 10.5 feet bgs.    On November 5, 1998, two single post semi-hydraulic hoists and one dual post hydraulic hoist with a oil-water clarifier were removed from within the station building.  Soil samples were collected from beneath each hoist at a depth of approximately eight feet bgs.  The soil samples contained no detectable concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons.    On December 3, 1998, soil samples were collected beneath four unleaded gasoline fuel dispensers.  The fiberglass secondary containment trenches were also inspected and appeared to be in good condition.  Four soil samples were collected, one from beneath each dispenser, at a depth of 3.5 feet bgs.  No detectable concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were found in the soil samples.    On January 3 and 4, 2007, five soil borings (B-1 through B-5) were advanced to depths of 11 to 13 feet bgs near the UST complex, dispenser islands, and former waste oil tank.  Soil samples were collected from the borings at depths ranging from three to nine feet bgs.  Grab groundwater samples were also collected from each boring except B-5 which meet refusal at five feet bgs.  The only detectable petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil samples were toluene and MTBE, reported at concentrations up to 0.001 ppm and 0.0006 ppm, respectively.  Analysis of grab groundwater samples detected up to 4,500 ppb TPHg and 5 ppb MTBE, with the highest detections in the groundwater sample collected from B-2.    On August 26, 2008, five soil vapor wells (VP-1 through VP-5) screened from 5 to 5.5 feet bgs were advanced throughout the western and central portion of the site.  Soil samples were collected from the vapor well borings at a depth of three feet bgs.  No petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in any of the soil samples.  The vapor wells were first sampled for soil vapor on September 11, 2008.  The vapor samples contained up to 330,000 micrograms per cubic meter (µg\/m3) TPHg; no concentrations of benzene or ethylbenzene were detected.

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health (ACEH) website at: http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm     This site is to be entered into the City of Oakland Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.    The subject site (APN 9-683-40) is located at 385 26th Street in Oakland, CA. The site is currently used as a commercial warehouse in a mixed residential-commercial neighborhood defined as the 25th Street Garage District in the City of Oakland’s Broadway Valdez District Specific Plan. Lake Merritt, the closest surface water body, is located approximately 1,900 feet southeast of the property. The direction of groundwater flow in the area appears to be towards the south, and is based on Fuel Leak Case RO0000480, 2600 Telegraph Avenue, located 500 feet northwest of the site.    A buried 1,200-gallon 12-foot diameter redwood underground storage tank (UST) was discovered at the site during grading activities on February 13, 2013. The UST contained an unknown volume of heating oil. The structural integrity of the redwood tank had been severely compromised and a large volume of heating oil had impacted surrounding soils. Since the redwood tank was badly decomposed, it was removed in pieces and placed in six 10-cubic yard roll-off bins along with contaminated soil and approximately 80 gallons of heating oil was removed from the excavation. The UST excavation extended to a depth of approximately 12 feet below ground surface (bgs). After excavation activities were complete, two soil samples were collected from the base of the excavation. Sample S1 was collected from the south end of the excavation at depth of approximately 10 feet below grade. Sample S2 was collected from the north end of the excavation (closest to 26th Street) at a depth of approximately 10 feet below grade. The samples appeared to be contaminated due to staining and hydrocarbon odor. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) and methyl tert butyl ether (MtBE) constituents were not detected above laboratory detection limits. Total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd) concentrations range from 6,500 to 11,000 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg). Naphthalene concentrations range from 10 to 14 mg\/kg. The UST excavation was backfilled with clean recycled base rock.    In November 2014 six soil borings, SB-1 through SB-5, were advanced through the center, north, and south sides of the former UST location and SB-6 was located approximately 80 feet south of the former redwood UST in the southern part of the site. Soil and grab groundwater samples collected from each soil boring indicate residual TPH as gasoline (TPHg), TPHd, and TPH as motor oil (TPHmo) impacts remain in soil and groundwater in the immediate vicinity of the former UST; volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were not detected above laboratory reporting limits in soil and groundwater with the exception of minor concentrations of naphthalene, toluene, and 4-Methyl-2-pentanone (MIBK). The VOCs 1,1-Dichloroethane (1,1 DCA), 1,2 Dichloroethane (1,2 DCA), 1,1 Dichloroethene (1,1 DCE), cis 1,2 Dichloroethene (cis 1,2 DCE), 1,1,2 Trichloroethane (1,1,2 TCA), and trichloroethene (TCE) were detected above their respective Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) in the  grab groundwater sample from boring SB-6 but were not detected in grab groundwater samples in the vicinity of the former redwood UST.  The only VOC detected in soil in SB-6 was 1,1 DCE at a concentration of 0.011 mg\/kg. This sample was collected at a depth of 24.5 feet.  Therefore, the chlorinated VOCs impacts detected in the southern portion of the property are likely due to historic automotive repair activities in the 25th Street Garage District.  Consequently, it would appear that the UST was not a source of the VOCs and the southern portion of the site may be a source for the chlorinated hydrocarbons.    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP). Based on this evaluation, due to residual contamination at the site, site management requirements are necessary. If there is a change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, ACEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.",

The abandoned plating facility contained hazardous materials and wastes, which were removed during an emergency response action directed by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), Office of Emergency Response in 1998\/1999. Subsequent soil and groundwater investigations have found that the soil and groundwater at the site have been impacted by metals, in particular hexavalent chromium (“Cr-VI”), and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), in particular, trichloroethene (“TCE”).  The primary source of metals and VOCs appears to have been a below-grade concrete structure referred to as the Frog Pond.     Between June and December 2007, the Frog Pond was removed and backfilled with gravel. The Frog Pond was subsequently covered with a concrete cap.  Hexavalent chromium and volatile organic compounds have been detected in soil and groundwater in the area of the Frog Pond.  A plume additional investigation is currently underway to define the extent of groundwater contamination.  Two off-site soil borings were proposed and were conditionally approved by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) to delineate the off-site extent of the hexavalent chromium groundwater plume.    The former plating facility site was separated into two separate parcels in 2016 designated as APN 1-223-7 and 1-223-6. This case was opened in 2015 for APN 1-223-7 to allow closure of RO0003174 while further investigation and remedial activities continue on APN 1-223-6 (RO0002586).  Site investigation activities on APN 1-223-7 are complete and thus ACDEH is proceeding with closure of RO0003174 under its current commercial land use as a circus and fitness facility.",

The removal of the former underground storage tank (UST) was reported in the January 12, 2018 Underground Storage Tank Closure Report (Tank Removal Report) by Golden Gate Tank Removal (GGTR). Based on the Tank Removal Report, the 2,000-gallon single-wall steel UST was discovered during site construction activities. The former UST was located between eight to thirteen feet below ground surface (bgs). The UST contained concrete and approximately 55-gallons of oily liquid residue. Sampling of the oily residue in the UST indicated the UST contained petroleum hydrocarbons in the diesel range; the UST contents were also analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which were not detected. At the time of removal, the UST was observed with holes found in the tank and significant visible soil contamination.  GGTR performed additional excavation and confirmation sampling, removed and disposed of the UST and its contents and the additional excavated soil. The UST and approximately 59 tons of petroleum impacted soil were removed from the excavation and over-excavation area, respectively. Groundwater was not encountered during tank removal activities. Site restoration was performed by the general contractor at the Site.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The approximately 17-acre site is currently owned by the Port of Oakland and is leased by the City of Oakland for use as a municipal corporation yard.  Site use includes material storage and vehicle fueling and repair facilities. The case was opened in 1995 following case oversight transfer from the RWQCB to ACDEH.  Gasoline releases at the site have been identified as early as 1984.  The site is bounded on two sides by open water- San Leandro Bay and the Damon slough.   Site is located over reclaimed marshland and open water areas of the San Leandro Bay.  The majority of the filling activities occurred between 1959 and 1971 with an estimated &gt;300,000 cu. yds. of import material from an unknown source(s).  The City of Oakland  currently operates both USTs and AGTs for petroleum fuels and fresh and spent lubricants.  Approximately 14 USTs have been previously removed from the site.      Review of soil gas investigation results, submitted 11-03-2017, show localized significant concentrations of TPHg, benzene, and methane.  Methane generation consistent with reduced O2 and increased CO2 levels.  Additional investigation will be performed with a soil vapor, soil and groundwater study for additional contaminant delineation.        ACDEH is currently working with the City of Oakland and its consultants to develop a site conceptual model and assess risk at site due to persistent and unknown source of benzene concentrations and high PAHs and other contaminants, potentially associated with fill material. The approximately 17-acre site is currently owned by the Port of Oakland and is leased by the City of Oakland for use as a municipal corporation yard.     The Site has been the subject of numerous environmental investigations beginning in about 1989. The suspected sources of on-site contamination include releases from underground storage tanks (USTs), gasoline and diesel fuel hydrant systems consisting of 38 fueling stations and 2650 feet of dispenser piping, and  floor drains and unlined waste collection pits formerly located adjacent to Building No. 5.  At one time there were 14 petroleum USTs at the site. In addition, some or all of the material used to fill the site may have been composed of waste material or contaminated fill.     A comprehensive investigation conducted by Baseline Environmental Consulting (Baseline) in 2000 identified the existence of free-phase petroleum hydrocarbon product in four separate areas of the Site. These four areas are labeled Plumes A through D.    Construction of a DPE system was completed in early May 2006.  Seven wells within Plume D area (RW-D1 through RW-D5, TBW-5, and RW-1) were connected to the extraction system. On May 22, 2006, the product recovery and groundwater extraction portion of the remediation system (pneumatic pumps) was turned on. On May 14, 2007, the DPE portion of the remediation system was turned on. The second phase included installation of six additional extraction wells (RW-D6 through RW-D11) within the Plume C area in March 2007 (URS, May 2007). They were connected to the DPE system and extraction from these wells commenced on June 11, 2007. The DPE systems for Plumes C and D operated from through December 2009. Chemical oxidation and enhanced bioremediation through periodic injections of hydrogen peroxied have been implemented at Plumes A and B since July 2004.    Soil vapor investigation conducted in 2017 reported up to 3.3E07 ug\/m3 TPHg, 6,500 ug\/m3 benzene and 43% methane.    Vertical GW contamination not defined as depth discrete sampling (MW-20C) documents 57 ug\/L TPHg in 30-35-foot zone. FP may remain in vicinity of MW-16.      Groundwater levels at the site range from approimately 2 to 10 feet below ground surface and are partially subject to tidal influence. Northern perimeter wells appear to be discharging TPHg into estuary- discharge concentration unclear as tidal influence may be diluting\/flushing wells.  Shallow groundwater flows predominately to the southwest- the nearest shorline along San Leandro Bay. In the northern portion of the site, groundwater flows in a more northerly direction.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently an active ARCO-brand gasoline retail station and consists of  a service station building and four gasoline USTs with associated piping and dispensers. Land use in the immediate vicinity is commercial. In May 1991 Gettler-Ryan, advanced four soil borings (A-B through A-E) during a preliminary soil investigation and well abandoment prior to UST replacement. In January 1992, Roux Associates collected nine soil samples (SW-1 through SW-9) during excavation and removal of four USTs.  Approximately 2,196 cubic yards of petroleum impacted soil was excavated and disposed of offsite and 10,000 gallons of groundwater removed from the excavation. Four new 10,000 gallon fiberglass USTs were subsequently installed. In February 1992, following removal of the product lines, Roux collected five soil samples (L1 through L5) from the product line trenches. Based on elevated concentrations of TPHd, overexcavation was conducted to remove additional contaminated soil. Components associated with a vapor and groundwater extraction system were installed  concurrently with the installation of new product piping to facilitate future installation.  In March 1992, GeoStrategies, Inc installed four monitoring wells A-1 through A-4 and one recovery well (AR-1).  In June 1992, GSI installed three vapor extraction wells (AV-1 through AV-3) and one recovery well (AR-2). In June 1992, GSI conducted a vapor extraction test and a step-drawdown aquifer test to asses the feasibility of a SVE and groundwater extraction system. In February 1993, GSI installed two off-site monitoring wells (A-5 and A-6). In September 1993, GSI installed 3 air sparge wells (AS-1 through AS-3) and two vapor extraction wells (AV-4 and AV-5) and performed air sparge\/vapor extraction pilot tests.  In December 1993, GSI installed two additional air sparge wells (AS- and AS-5), two vapor extraction wells (AV-6 and AV-7), and two dual groundwater recovery\/vapor extraction wells ADR-1 and ADR-2. Operation of the air sparge and vapor extraction system began in June 1994 and continued until December 2001 when the system was shutdown due to low concentrations. The groundwater extraction system never operated.      SVE system was installed and operated from 1994 to 1998.  In 1998, began biosparge operation, which ceased in 2001.      The site was evaluated for case closure under the State Water Resources Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy.  Based upon the information available in our files to date, no further investigation or cleanup for the fuel leak case is necessary at this time.      Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.

In 1966, the old station building and UST were reportedly removed, and a new station building was constructed and two 10,000 gallon gasoline USTs and one 230 gallon waste oil UST were installed at the site.  The station building and was reportedly demolished and the USTs removed from the site in 1983.     During a street widening project in 1989, petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil in a utility trench, and as a result an investigation was conducted to delineate the soil and groundwater impacts. In 1990, 26 borings were advanced and 6 groundwater monitoring wells were installed to determine the extent of contamination. Results of investigations indicated that petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents had been released to soil and groundwater from the former USTs located at the site, and from the former Richfield service station USTs that operated on the adjacent parcel located at 692 98th Street from 1947 until 1962. In 1970, four 1,000 gallon USTs were reportedly removed from 692 98th Street, however the tank contents and locations are unknown.     In order to facilitate completion of the 98th Avenue street widening project, interim remedial actions were conducted in 1990 by the City of Oakland to remediate contaminated soil in the vicinity of a planned joint utility trench and included excavation (to depths of 10 to 13 feet below ground surface) and offsite disposal of  approximately 1,200 cubic yards  contaminated backfill in the former UST pits and within the trench alignment. Soil samples collected from the base and sidewalls of the excavation contained concentrations of TPHg up to 2,100 mg\/kg.    Groundwater monitoring was conducted from 1993 to 1996. Free product has been observed in downgradient well MW-1.    In 1997, 13 temporary wellpoints were installed in the vicinity of the site to determine the extent of petroleum and chlorinated VOC contamination in groundwater. a hot spot was identified at WP-8 downgradient of the site with benzene concentrations of 3,800 ug\/L.    Soil gas samples were collected in March 1999 in four locations at the site and in the surrounding area and a RBCA Tier 2 Health Risk Assessment completed.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Fuel Leak Case No. RO0003364 was opened in 2019 by ACDEH following removal of a 250-gallon single-walled steel home heating oil underground storage tank (UST) that was discovered at the Site in a grass area in the backyard during a geophysical survey in 2018 in preparation for construction of a new addition to the house. The UST was removed under an Oakland Fire department permit in January 2019. During removal, the top of the three-foot diameter UST was located approximately one- to two feet below the ground surface (bgs) and was observed to be in poor condition with several holes in the bottom.     On January 23, 2019 following UST removal, one soil sample (UST-6) was collected from approximately twp-feet below the bottom of the former UST at a depth of approximately six feet bgs and analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbon as diesel (TPH d); naphthalene; benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX); and fuel oxygenates and lead scavengers, including ethylene dibromide (EDB), ethylene dichloride (EDC), methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE), di isopropyl ether (DIPE), and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA). Analytical results documented TPH-d and naphthalene at a concentration of 460 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) and 0.15 mg\/kg, respectively in the bottom of the tank excavation pit. Concentration of all other analytes were below laboratory reporting limits appropriate for evaluating risk.     A three-point composite sample (STKP 1-1-3) was collected from the stockpile generated during tank removal and analyzed for the same chemicals mentioned above for characterization. Diesel and naphthalene were detected at concentrations of 10 mg\/kg and 0.011 mg\/kg, respectively, with concentrations of all other analytes below laboratory reporting limits appropriate for evaluating risk. The UST Removal Report, dated May 3, 2019 prepared AEI Consultants does not document the final disposition of the excavated soil stockpile. As no waste manifests documenting offsite disposal were included in the report ACDEH assumes the stockpiled soil was used to backfill the excavation pit. This assumption is supported by a discussion with the Property Owner whereby they indicated the pit was partially backfilled while waiting for a permit to construct the new addition to the house.     The concentrations of TPH-d and naphthalene detected in the soil collected beneath the tank and the stockpile are indicative of an unauthorized release from the former UST.       Results of Site investigations indicate the following:  • Soil at the Site consists predominantly of clay, with intermittent lenses of sandy clay, silty clay and caliche based on logs of borings advanced during Site investigation activities.    • First encountered groundwater was encountered at depths greater than 15 feet bgs. A stabilized groundwater level of 6.5 feet bgs was observed in boring SB-6 indicating the groundwater at the Site is likely semi-confined.     • The groundwater flow direction is inferred to be to the southwest based on the local topographic gradient.    • A comparison of residual concentrations in soil within and beneath the backfilled tank pit to the 2019 San Francisco Bay Regional Water quality Control Board’s Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) indicate the following:     TPH-d concentrations exceed the residential ESL for direct contact human health risk of 260 mg\/kg. Concentrations of all other constituents analyzed are below the residential direct contact ESLs.     TPH-d and naphthalene concentrations are below the ESLs for construction worker direct contact human health risk of 1,100 mg\/kg and 400 mg\/kg, respectively. Concentrations of all other constituents analyzed are below the residential direct contact ESLs.     Naphthalene concentrations exceed the ESLs for leaching to groundwater for drinking water, however do not exceed the ESL for leaching to groundwater for non-drinking water. Concentrations of all other constituents analyzed are below the leaching to ESLs for non-drinking and drinking water.    • A comparison of concentrations of TPH-d, TPH-mo, and naphthalene in grab groundwater samples to the ESLs indicate the following:     TPH-d concentrations exceed the direct exposure human risk level of 200 micrograms per liter (µg\/L) for drinking water and the odor nuisance levels for drinking water of 100 µg\/L.     The laboratory reporting limit for naphthalene exceeds the ESL for direct exposure human risk level of 0.17 µg\/L for drinking water.     There are no ESL for TPH-mo    • French drains are installed beneath the patio located adjacent to the UST pit. Building plans for the proposed addition to the house in the area overlying the existing patio and UST pit show a network of new french drains beneath and adjacent to the new foundation to intercept groundwater. Concentrations of TPH-d in the tank pit area exceed leaching to groundwater ESLs and therefore TPH-d impacted groundwater may be intercepted by the French drains and discharged to the street.     • BTEX was detected in the soil vapor samples collected from beneath the patio slab however BTEX was not detected in soil samples collected 2 feet below the bottom of the tank, and therefore the detections of BTEX in soil vapor is not likely associated with the UST release. Methane was not detected above 0.400 percent. The Case file does not include any information on whether  individually certified clean cannisters or batch-certified cannisters were used in the sample collection which may have attributed to the low level concentrations of BTEX in soil vapor. Regardless of the source, the concentrations of BTEX are below concentrations that pose a risk to human health from vapor intrusion to indoor air. Additionally, although the reporting limits for naphthalene were above the ESLs for vapor intrusion, the low concentrations of naphthalene detected in soil indicate that naphthalene is not likely to generate soil vapor at concentrations that would pose a risk to occupants from vapor intrusion.     ACDEH listed the site as eligible for closure in June 2020 and completed a 60-day public comment period, however during preparation of the Case Closure Summary, ACDEH determined that additional removal of secondary source material remaining in the UST pit is required to eliminate the exposure pathway for petroleum impacted groundwater to enter the existing and proposed french drains installed directly adjacent to the the tank pit. Based on discussion with the property owner , the secondary source removal will be conducted during construction of the new addition to the house in the Spring of 2021. Upon completion of the secondary source removal, ACDEH will close the case.",

Approximately 400 cubic yards of soil was removed and disposes off-site.  One  gasoline UST and associated pump island, piping, and storage shed was removed from the site in 1995.  free-phase gasoline was observed on the water surface in the tank excavation.  Approximately 1,500 cubic yards of soil was removed and approximately 116,000 gallons of groundwater was pumped following UST removal.  A 30-foot by 70-foot by 9-foot deep excavation was completed in April 2002 south of the original UST excavation.  Approximately 219 tons of petroleum-contaminated soil was disposed off-site.  Groundwater monitoring well installations followed.  Additional subsurface investigations at the site revealed TPH-g, metals, and PCB contamination.  Active remediation was performed.  Verification monitoring is currently underway at the site.    Building 200 is located adjacent to the southwest of the former gasoline UST excavation. Building 300 is located adjacent to the west of the former gasoline UST excavation. The interpreted groundwater flow direction has ranged from westward to southward. The estimated regional groundwater flow direction is to the west. The depth to groundwater is less than 5 feet.    Building 200 consists of classrooms and Building 300 is a gymnasium. Building 200 includes a crawlspace over a \"rat slab\" emplaced over soil. The rat slab is an element of the site cap relative to residual PCB contamination in soils. Building 300 was constructed with a passive VMS. To address vapor intrusion concerns to restrooms and other enclosed spaces within Building 300, Aspire Schools has proposed upgrading the VMS to active mode.    Additional groundwater sampling is proposed and will be used to evaluate residual impacts from the former gasoline UST system. Residual gasoline impacts and metals impacts to soil (including lead and arsenic) are anticipated to remain post-closure and on Operation, Monitoring, and Maintenance Plan is being prepared to manage residual contaminants in-place.",

In December 1990 the gasoline and diesel USTs and any encountered piping were removed, and the USTs and residual liquid were disposed as hazardous waste. Sludge removed from the diesel UST was reportedly found to contain chlorinated hydrocarbons. The two waste oil USTs were removed in February of 1991. Historical records indicate that plastic sheeting and an unknown volume of impacted soil were placed into the remedial diesel and gasoline excavations to prevent wall failure below the groundwater table and clean imported fill was placed over the impacted soil to bring the remedial excavations up to grade. In 1993 an unknown amount of petroleum was manually removed from the groundwater surface from one monitoring well. The Site is currently monitored with a network of seven groundwater monitoring wells and five soil gas wells. The primary chemicals of concern include petroleum-related and chlorinated hydrocarbons in soil, groundwater, and soil vapor. To date, there have been no significant cleanup activities at the Site. The Site is under regulatory oversight of the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH).    Cleanup is proposed consisting of excavation to remove contaminated soil from the Site, beginning in Summer 2022.    ACDEH is accepting comments on the planned cleanup through the end of February 2022.

Liquid bleach was manufactured from 1919-1981, which used elemental mercury as an electrical conductor in mercury-cell manufacturing process until 1957. In the late 1950s, the mercury and associated equipment was removed from the property. Dry bleach production occurred at the subject property from 1972-1992. There are two conjoined buildings at the property; the northern two-story building, and the southern one-story building. The historical manufacturing activities occurred primarily in the one-story building. Mercury concentrations have been identified in soil, soil vapor, groundwater, building materials and indoor air at the subject property. A deed restriction for the subject property has been recorded with the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), and is available on DTSC's Envirostor ID no. 01280083.    Initial investigations occurred at the property in 1981, which identified concentrations of mercury in soil and groundwater. Routine groundwater monitoring has been occurring at the property since 1995. Groundwater is not used for drinking water at the subject property.     Historical remedial activities include 1) removal of a portion of the concrete slab in the area of the mercury cells, 2) excavation and treatment of approximately 430 cubic yards of soil from beneath the building, which was replaced following heat treatment, and 3) operation of a groundwater treatment system to remove mercury from groundwater.    Due to the concentrations of mercury in indoor air, Clorox and the property owner have recently implemented mitigation measures to rapidly reduce the concentrations of mercury in indoor air. These measures include increased ventilation, deployment of air filters, and floor treatment. Clorox is currently working on sealing the concrete floors in the one-story building.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In July 1988 an ATT manhole 300 feet west of the site was found to have gasoline leaking into it, and a request to test the USTs was made.  In February 1989 a soil vapor survey (VP-1 to VP-19) was conducted at the site; concentrations indicated a release.  In March 1989 wells MW-1 to MW-5 were installed.  In June 1990 wells MW-6 to MW-9 were installed offsite.  In June 1990 the station was demolished and three 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs and one 1,000-gallon waste oil UST were removed.  Well MW-2 was destroyed in the process of overexcavating impacted soil in 1990 and 1991; approximately 1,500 cubic yards were excavated.  Of that total approximately 800 cubic yards were aerated and reused onsite.  In December 1992 the City of Oakland purchased the property.  A parking lot and landscaping was constructed over the western portion of the site and Bay Place was expanded over the eastern portion.  In January 1993 a groundwater extraction system was installed in well MW-5.  The system was shut down in January 1995 due to low production rates.  On December 1, 1995 wells MW-1 and MW-3 were decommissioned.  In November 1996 an additional 200 cubic yards of soil was excavated due to the installation of a new storm drain on Montecito Avenue.  A one week long two-phase extraction pilot test was conducted on well MW-5 in September 2005.  In August 2008 periodic injection of oxygen into well MW-5 was proposed; work was implemented in February 2009 and successfully reduced hydrocarbon concentrations in groundwater.  Soil bore B-6 was installed in mid 2014 to determine if groundwater is in a confined or unconfined condition, and to help determine the downgradient extent of contamination.  Subsequent investigations into a storm drain preferential pathway allowed dissolved-phase contamination to bypass the well network and discharge to Glen Echo Creek.  Upon analysis, the storm drain may not be of concern; however, substantial contaminant concentrations remain in and around well MW-5.  Consequently, a targeted corrective actions have been identified to be implemented in the vicinity of well MW-5.",

The entire west side of the property borders the Tidal Canal. The property structures include four-story-high grain elevators and a manufacturing building, a truck refueling area, railroad car and truck container parking areas, a railroad spur and asphalt-paved parking lots.      In 1989, a 1,000-gallon diesel underground storage tank (UST) was removed from the property and off-hauled to H&amp;H Ship Service at 220 China Basin in San Francisco for disposal under a hazardous waste manifest on January 31, 1989, along with 50 gallons of rinsate water. Following tank removal, two soil samples were collected at 12 feet deep from the vent and fill ends of the former tank by Blymer Engineers Inc. on January 31, 1989,  Samples were received by Trace Analytical Lab on 1\/31\/1989 for testing by EPA method 8010 for VOCs , DHS Method Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel and gasoline, Modified  EPA Method 8020 for BTEX and Standard Method 503E for oil and grease. The testing results were reported in a Trace Analytical Report dated March 7, 1989. The fill end had 50 mg\/kg of oil and grease, but all other sample results were non detect. Based on the analytical results, Alameda County Health Care Services Agency, HazMat Division responded to ConAgra in a letter dated March 14, 1989, addressed to Lloyd McQuilliam of ConAgra, that the concentrations were below 100 mg\/kg and therefore the tank removal is formally \"closed\". Subsequent site assessment was conducted by Ninyo and Moore on 2009 as part of the Central Estuary Specific Plan (CESP) in 2009. For more information on the results of the 2009 investigation, refer to the November 17, 2009, Limited Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Report in \"all site documents\".  The November 19, 2009, report for CESP provides soil and groundwater sampling data for several properties: 2201 E. 7th Street, 333 Kennedy Street, 2915 Ford Street, 344 High Street, 4575 Tidewater Avenue, and Tidewater Business Park (4703 through 4723 Tidewater Avenue).

Prologis purchased the property in 2019 and conducted Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments that identified areas to investigate further. Site improvement plans include demolition of all of the structures on the 6825 parcel, and surface improvements for parking trucks.    The Site is located approximately 500 feet northwest of the Oakland Coliseum BART Station. Key nearby features include Lion Creek to the north, and the mainline Union Pacific railroad tracks, and Arroyo Viejo Creek to the west.     At the time of 2018 Phase I and II Environmental Assessments the following businesses occupied the properties: 6815 San Leandro St. was KG Singh Trucking; 6825 San Leandro St. was Mobile Fleet Care (10 years); and 6905 San Leandro St. was JM&amp;R Trucking and M&amp;M Transport (sublease from JM&amp;R Trucking) (20 years). Historical operations includes lumber sales for 37 years.    In 2018, Prologis conducted a soil and groundwater investigation and identified soil and  groundwater contamination consisting primarily of petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel   and motor oil, lead, and low levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In response to  Prologis’ June 2020 Soil Removal Workplan, Regional Water Board staff requested   additional sampling to further characterize PCBs, and Prologis conducted the additional  sampling in December 2020.    In September 2021, the Water Board approved a workplan to conduct soil removal on the properties. The soil removal activities are proposed during the demolition of structures on the 6825 parcel, and grading activities across the Site. The soil removal activities are an initial action to improve the subsurface conditions by reducing any potential impacts to onsite   workers, and the environment (groundwater, surface water, and stormwater). The  largest excavation (75 by 75-foot area) is proposed near the northwestern corner of  6825 parcel where the highest soil concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons, PCBs, and lead were detected. This area is the former motor and hydraulic oil storage and  handling area by the former vehicle maintenance company. Other excavation areas are targeted to remove surficial petroleum hydrocarbons identified during the previous  investigations, and any visual impacts observed during the demolition of existing structures on the 6825 parcel. Prologis implemented the workplan in October 2021.     The Water Board also approved a workplan to install a network of groundwater monitoring wells on the parcels to evaluate groundwater conditions. The wells will be installed following the soil removal activities.",

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm     This site is to be entered into the City of Oakland Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.    The subject site is currently in commercial use as a shopping center and is comprised of two parcels, APN 9-684-11 (2600 Telegraph Avenue) and 9-684-12-1 (2630 Telegraph Avenue) located in Oakland, California.  Lake Merritt, the closest surface water body, is located approximately 2,450 feet southeast of the property. The direction of site groundwater flow is towards the south.    Two 10,000 gallon gasoline USTs were removed prior to September 1990.  In September 1990, five 1,000-gallon motor oil, one 2,000-gallon motor oil, one 1,000-gallon waste oil USTs were removed from the site in addition to the excavation and removal of 55 cubic yards of contaminated soil.  Soil borings and groundwater monitoring wells were installed at the site between February 1991 and December 1992.  Elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil and free product was present in monitoring well MW-3.  In June 1996, a Soil Vapor Extraction System (SVE) bioventing pilot test was performed at the site.  Additionally, Soakease absorbent socks were installed in site wells and vacuum extraction was performed between September 1999 and in July 2000.  In 2004, fourteen confirmation soil borings were installed to evaluate remedial effectiveness and the groundwater monitoring wells were sampled.  Elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil.  In December 2008, the groundwater monitoring wells were sampled and two additional borings were installed in the vicinity of MW-3 to investigate the status of free product, which was not found in either soil or groundwater.    This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP).  The case meets all the general and media-specific criteria of the LTCP. However, because a waste oil UST was removed from the site and no soil samples were collected from depths less than five feet below ground surface that were analyzed for polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), ACEH has made the determination that there is low potential for direct contact exposure because of the current land use as a shopping center and the entire site is paved.  Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, Alameda County Environmental health (ACEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    This site is to be entered into the City of Oakland Permit Tracking System due to the residual contamination on site.",

Prior to work associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003192, the Leaking Underground Fuel Tank (LUFT) Case No. RO0000251 at the Site was closed under the condition of continued commercial use.      When the property owner requested ACDEH to redevelop the Site for residential use in 2015, additional environmental investigations were required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to automobile service and repair operations with associated former underground fuel storage tanks.      Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes a 5-story residential building with 20 apartment units on the second through fifth floor and 3,000 square feet of ground floor commercial space on the eastern portion of the property.  An elevator shaft on the south side of the building will extend from the basement up to the fifth floor. The western portion of the property will consist of subgrade storage and parking on the ground floor. Redevelopment will include the demolishment of the existing commercial structure and excavation of soil to about 12 feet below ground surface for construction of subgrade storage area and to a depth of approximately 16 feet for an elevator shaft.    Subsurface investigations have identified Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), BTEX constituents, and methane in soil vapor that pose a risk to indoor air quality. To address this contamination prior to redevelopment, proposed corrective actions include the demolition of existing Site buildings and above ground infrastructure; remediation and\/or off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; extraction, treatment, and discharge of groundwater to the sanitary sewer; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/MAPS\/DEH\/InspectionResults\/.      At the time of closure of LUST Case No. RO0003143; T10000006106 the Site is a single family residential home located at 811 Paramount Road in Trestle Glen, a historic residential district in Oakland, California.    An approximately 350-gallon underground storage tank (USST) was removed from the site on December 16, 2013.  The tank was found to be in poor condition with at least one visible hole.  Soil discoloration and petroleum hydrocarbon odors were observed in the stockpiled soil and soil underlying the tank.  Soil samples collected from the tank pit contained up to 9,290 ppm of total petroleum hydrocarbons (C10-C28).  The tank pit was overexcavated to a depth of approximately 12 feet bgs to remove petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soils.  Following the overexcavation, two soil samples were collected from the bottom of the excavation at a depth of approximately 12 feet bgs.  The soil sample from the western end of the tank pit contained 3,960 ppm of TPH (C10-C28).    Soil vapor sampling has indicated elevated Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) and benzene at the UST location, which is reported to have been a heating oil UST.  Additionally 1,1,2-Trichloroethane was detected in soil vapor at concentrations two orders of magnitude above the San Fransisco Bay Regional Board's Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs).  The soil vapor sampling locations are within 5 feet of the residential home.  Subsequent investigations indicated the chlorinated compounds were due to the use of batch certified Summa canisters.    Investigation activities occurred between 2013 to 2018 and investigated hydrocarbon contamination in soil, soil gas, indoor air, and outdoor air at the subject site.  Soil bores (SB1 through SB11) were installed at the site to a total depth of 36 feet bgs.  Analysis for TPHd, TPHmo, and TPHg, (EPA Method 8015M) and full scan VOCs by EPA Method 8260 was conducted.  Groundwater was not encountered to a depth of 36 feet bgs; consequently, a groundwater sample was not collected.  Soil vapor was measured in two soil vapor wells (SG5.5 and SG-13) at depths 5.5 feet bgs and 13 feet bgs respectively.  These samples were analyzed for TPHg, TPHd, and full scan VOCs using EPA analysis method TO-15 and TO-17.    Subslab soil vapor was measured from samples SSG1, SSG1-d, and SSG2 and was analyzed using EPA analysis method TO-15 and TO-17.  Indoor air samples were collected from the crawl space (IA-1), a basement room (IA-2), and the first floor living room (IA-3), using EPA analysis method TO-15 and TO-17.  Ambient air samples were also taken from sample OA-1 using  EPA analysis method TO-15 and TO-17.    Remedial excavation was conducted in August 2018.  Soil confirmation samples (EB-16, EE-13, ES-12) were taken from the base and sidewalls of the remedial excavation.  These samples were analyzed for TPHd, TPHmo, TPHg, and full scan VOCs.    This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  ACDEH determined that the site met all the LTCP General Criteria and Media Specific Criteria and therefore poses a low risk to human health and safety and the environment.  The determination was based on receptors and environmental conditions identified at and in the vicinity of the site at the time of closure and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios.    While the site met all General and Media-Specific Criteria, the case was required to remain open due to the documentation of naphthalene vapor intrusion to the basement and upper floor in the living room.  Ultimately, the identification of a storm drain preferential pathway and a data cable conduit between floors was determined to be the mechanism of vapor intrusion.  Remedial overexcavation of the residual source in the vicinity of soil bore SB7 was conducted to a depth of 13 to 16 feet bgs, and all elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil were removed from the site and disposed of offsite at the Keller Canyon Landfill.  Limited residual contamination in the vicinity of SB4 remains beneath the site but is not expected to significantly affect vapor intrusion to the structure.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site is an active container transfer station for the Port of Oakland maritime port.  At the time the case was open, the site was a trucking facility which included operating four underground storage tanks (USTs).  A geophysical survey conducted at the site on February 8, 1993 identified the presence of the USTs.  The four USTs were removed on September 22, 1993 by PTS Environmental.  In 1994 and 1995, several borings and monitoring wells were installed at the site.  Significantly elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil and over six feet of free product were detected in groundwater monitoring well MW-3.  Active skimmers commenced operation in November 15, 1996 and ceased in May 2011.  MW-8, was never sampled  as it contained separate phase petroleum product.  MW-8 was decommissioned due to railroad construction and was replaced by MW-8A on the general vicinity of the MW-8 well location. No separate phase petroleum product has been reported in the replacement well.  Two additional wells (MW-6 and MW-7) were decommissioned as a result of Port improvements.  A Trucking facility located on the adjacent parcel also operated USTs which experienced a release, resulting the opening a case, RO000187.  These cases were eventually merged following port redevelopment.  Post development replacement wells were installed and free product removal restarted. ORC added to MW-4 in 2006 and a low vacuum system added in 2007 to recovery wells for enhanced recovery.  Free product removal ceased on 6\/07\/2011. Since shutdown, separate phase petroleum product thickness has increased in six wells by up to 7.66 feet,  Well screens for some wells always submerged and occasionally true for several other MWs.  However, extent of the plume appears stable or deceasing.    Most recent activity was a meeting held on July 28, 2020.  ACDEH will issue a letter requesting additional work, including contaminant plume map, historical well status table, well redevelopment and sampling and relation of site to the Port of Oakland Cold Storage Facility.       O2 measurements are &lt;4% LNAPL plume and  &gt;4% outside of plume area.    .    Metals include 880 mg\/kg As, 680 mg\/kg Pb and 600 mg\/kg Zn; however, site s capped.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is a former Shell service station located in a mixed commercial and residential area of Oakland, CA.  The site is currently a vacant lot.  All surface features, underground storage tanks, dispensers, and piping were removed in January and February 2003.  Approximately 875 cubic yards of soil were removed from the site during the 2003 tank removal.  Various site investigation activities and groundwater monitoring have taken place since 1993.

The upstream reach of the Creek adjacent to these upland properties includes a straight, approximate 500-foot concrete-lined channel bed with soft soil\/sediment banks leading to a 90-degree elbow-shaped channel that is fully concrete-lined (channel and banks). The Creek is unlined downstream of the 90-degree elbow for approximately 1,500 feet to the intersection of Lion Creek.    The upland areas, stream banks, and submerged sediments within the Creek have been contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The highest concentrations of PCBs are located adjacent to the upland areas. The Creek is tidally influenced, and the downstream reach of the project area is approximately 3,000 feet from San Leandro Bay. There is currently a tentative order being finalized for the subject area. The upland portions of the project are overseen by the Department of Toxic Substances Control and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.",

The Site was redeveloped in 2016\/2017 into a 59-unit multi-family building. The entirety of the site is permanently covered with a combination of the following elements: (1) the building slab and underlying engineered fill, (2) asphalt or concrete paved surfaces on top of base rock, (3) permeable paving on top of base rock, (4) planters on top of permeable paving, (5) rubber safety surfacing on top of concrete pavement, or (6) landscaping soil on top of clean fill. Prior to redevelopment the investigation and remedial excavation was conducted under former Site Cleanup program Case No. RO0003232 and GeoTracker Site ID T10000008353. Remedial excavation of historic fill material was conducted to remove shallow metals contamination at the site. Confirmation sampling results from the excavations indicated that residual arsenic concentration beneath the clean imported fill remains as a chemical of concern. The SMP presents guidelines for appropriate health and safety precautions for on-site workers who may access soil beneath the cap that could contain residual chemicals, provides a plan for management of site soil beneath the cap disturbed during operations, maintenance, or development activities in a manner that protects human health and the environment, and presents procedures for long-term management (i.e., during ongoing site operations or maintenance activities) of the residual chemical present in soil a the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Case was opened following ACDEH’s receipt of an Unauthorized Release Form (URF) dated January 17, 2017 which identifies an unauthorized release of petroleum hydrocarbons from a fuel dispenser. The reported release was identified during an upgrade to the on-site underground storage tank (UST) system in November of 2016.     Following the opening of the Case, ACDEH requested submittal of a technical document (the \"CSM &amp; Closure Evaluation\") that evaluated the following:     1) The conceptual site model (CSM) for the Site and any data gaps in the CSM;  2) Site conditions identified during the November 2016 sampling event against the conditions at the time of regulatory case closure for the historic on-site LUST case identified by ACDEH case number RO0002853 and GeoTracker Global ID number T0600112421 (the “Historic Closed LUST Case”);  3) Site conditions identified during the November 2016 sampling event against regulatory case closure criteria presented in the State Water Board's Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (LTCP).     The CSM &amp; Closure Evaluation concludes that, although petroleum hydrocarbons are present in soil and groundwater at concentrations exceeding the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board's  January 2019 Tier 1 Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs), the petroleum hydrocarbons identified during the November 2016 eventare consistent with conditions at the time of closure of the historic on-site LUST case and are therefore not indicative of a new release. The CSM &amp; Closure Evaluation also concludes that the LTCP general and media specific criteria are satisfied with the exception of the groundwater media specific criteria which is not met due to the extents of the methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) groundwater plume that exceeds water quality objectives not being defined.     ACDEH concurs with the conclusion that petroleum hydrocarbons identified during the removal and upgrade of the on-site UST system in 2016 are consistent with conditions at the time of the closure and are not indicative of the presence of a new unauthorized release. ACDEH notes that although there are variations in groundwater data collected during the November 2016 sampling and the groundwater concentrations reported at the time of closure in 2010, the reported concentrations are within the historic range of post corrective action (remedial excavation) groundwater concentrations reported for the historic LUST case. ACDEH also notes that some variation is expected when comparing grab groundwater samples (November 2016 sampling event) against samples collected from developed groundwater monitoring wells (conditions at closure of Historic Closed LUST Case).     With regards to the MTBE groundwater plume, although the extent of the groundwater plume is not defined to water quality objectives, the groundwater ingestion exposure pathway is considered incomplete for the following reasons:   1. The Site is located within the service area of a public water system (East Bay Municipal Utility District);  2. No domestic water wells were identified within 1,000 feet of the Site in the Department of Water Resources or GAMA databases;  3. Groundwater at the Site is not anticipated to be a source of drinking water; and  4. Groundwater is greater than 10 feet below ground surface.    ACDEH notes that MTBE does not exceed non-drinking water environmental screening levels under a commercial land use scenario and therefore does not represent an unacceptable risk to on-site receptors or adjacent commercial receptors under the current land use scenario.     With regards to off-site residential receptors, although on-site grab groundwater samples collected in 2005 and 2015 exceed the vapor intrusion ESL under a residential land use scenario (450 ug\/L), ACDEH notes that grab groundwater samples are not as representative as groundwater samples from developed groundwater monitoring wells. ACDEH further notes that the two highest reported groundwater MTBE concentrations are both from the 2005 grab groundwater sampling event (820 ug\/l in SB-6-W and 1,400 ug\/L in SB-6-W2) which are within 10 feet of MW-4 which was installed in 2006 and has a maximum reported MTBE concentration of 6.5 ug\/L over the 13 groundwater sampling events conducted between 2006 the closure of the Historic Closed LUST Case. ACDEH further notes that MTBE did not exceed the residential vapor intrusion screening level in any of the quarterly groundwater samples collected from the five on-site groundwater monitoring wells between August 2006 and November 2009 (total of 65 samples) except for in three samples collected from MW-5 in August 2006 (829 ug\/L), November 2006 (640 ug\/L), August 2007 (580). Therefore, it is not anticipated that vapor intrusion risk is significant for residential structures located down to cross gradient (west) of the Site.       Therefore, ACDEH has determined that no further action is warranted for the Case and administratively closed the Case.  Please note that conditions of closure identified in the Historic Closed LUST Case remain in effect and that the Case and the Historic Closed LUST Case are closed under the current land use scenario.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "From Envirostor:    The Oakland Army Reserve Exchange (Site) consists of three non-contiguous properties near the eastern terminus of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. The Site includes (1) the Heroic War Dead United States Army Reserve Center at 2400 Engineer Road, Oakland, California, 16 acres, (2) former Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Parcels 6 and 7 (also known as the Subaru Lot), 19 acres, at the former Oakland Army Base, and (3) former BRAC Parcels 18 and portions of former BRAC Parcels 19 and 21, 6.76 acres, at the former Oakland Army Base. These areas total to approximately 42 acres. The United States Army Reserve is the property owner of the Site. The Headquarters, United States Army, 63D Regional Readiness Command in Los Alamitos, California is managing all operations at the Site.    Previous site assessment and investigation efforts reveal that the Site is potentially impacted in soil and groundwater with metals, volatile organic compounds, semi-volatile organic compounds, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and total petroleum hydrocarbons. Detailed chemical data for the Site would be available upon completion of remedial investigation.    The Site area was principally intertidal mudflats as late as the early 1930s. Landfilling activities created the land for the development of industrial, commercial, and military facilities. Since the mid-1930s, the Site vicinity has been used for industrial, shipping and maritime, and military and government agency facilities and activities.     The Site is composed of office buildings, maintenance and storage buildings, and open lots used to support mission requirements for the Heroic War Dead United States Army Reserve Center. The current land use includes the following: United States Army Reserve administration, vehicle maintenance and repair operations, and medical equipment and vehicle storage activities.    DTSC issued a Conditional Remedy Completion Letter for Parcels 6 and 7 in August 2004. On June 7, 2007, DTSC approved the “Removal Action Workplan, Heroic War Dead United States Army Reserve Center, Oakland, California.”    The Army Reserve and the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) implemented the remedy as selected in the Removal Action Workplan. The June 2007 Remedy Completion Report documents the field cleanup activities consisting of: (a) constructing an engineered asphalt cap over lead contaminated soil in the Building 1070 Yard, (b) advancing additional exploratory borings, test pits, and an exploratory excavation in the Building 1064 Yard near the PV18 test pit area, and (c) installing additional groundwater monitoring wells in the Building 1070 Yard. The Army Reserve and EBMUD implemented field cleanup activities in general accordance with the DTSC approved Remedial Design Work Plan dated June 2007 for the site.    The Army Reserve recorded the “Covenant to Restrict Use of Property, Environmental Restriction” with the Alameda County Assessor’s Office on June 29, 2007. DTSC effectively approved the Remedy Completion Report on June 29, 2007. The Army Reserve transferred the Heroic War Dead to EBMUD on June 29, 2007; and former BRAC Parcels 18 and portions of former BRAC Parcels 19 and 21 to the Port of Oakland on June 29, 2007. DTSC and the Port of Oakland signed a Consent Agreement on June 29, 2007.",

This ESA identified several recognized environmental conditions (RECs) which had not yet been evaluated which are outlined below:    1) On-site historic gasoline and oil service station at 570 16th Street;  2) Off-site historic gasoline and oil service station at 620 17th Street (Oak Grove North);  3) Off-site leaking underground storage tank case adjacent to the Site at 1700 Jefferson Street;  4) Multiple adjacent historical and active dry cleaning facilities; and  5) Former adjacent historical auto-station (Mash Petroleum Inc.) at 1721 Jefferson Street.    These RECs were investigated as part of a soil and soil vapor subsurface investigation conducted by Rincon Consultants, Inc. in February 2019 on behalf of the Oakland Housing Authority (the property owner). The results of this subsurface investigation indicate that contaminants associated with petroleum hydrocarbons, lead, and halogenated hydrocarbons are present in soil and soil vapor at the Site. At this time, further investigation is warranted to identify the source and characterize the extents and stability of of subsurface contamination at and in the vicinity of the Site. Further investigation is also warranted to evaluate potentially complete and unacceptable exposure pathways at the Site to determine if implementation of remediation and\/or mitigation measures are necessary for the protection of human health and the environment.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is located in a commercial\/industrial area located to the west of Interstate I-580.  It is bordered to the south by Coliseum Way, to the southeast by 50th Avenue and to the north by industrial properties. The site was used by PG&amp;E as a natural gas distribution center and equipment storage facility from the late 1930s until 1990, when a former gas-holder tank was removed. Since 1990, the site has been used as an equipment and vehicle storage facility.  PG&amp;E personnel occupy a small office on-site during regular business hours.     The gas holder tank was originally painted with lead-based paint and sandblasted on-site during historical site activities. In 1992, a Covenant of Deed Restriction was put into effect stating that the site remain covered with asphalt to prevent the lateral and vertical spread of lead impacts to ground and surface water with an additional requirement to inspect the cap annually.    A Corrective Action Plan dated July 2, 2012, which was approved in 2013, selected maintenance of an asphalt cap to cover areas where lead concentrations in soil exceed regulatory levels for industrial\/commercial use in conjunction with a Site Management Plan and administrative controls.  ACEH recently received a document entitled, “Corrective Action Plan Implementation Workplan, Oakland Construction Yard, 4930 Coliseum Way, Oakland, California,” dated January 2016, which proposes specific repair and replacement activities for the existing asphalt cap at the site.  A report documenting the cap repair and and replacement activities is to be submitted by July 29, 2016.  Following submittal of the Cap Repair and Maintenance Report, a Soil Management Plan and an updated Covenant and Environmental Restriction on Property are to be completed.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "One UST was removed from the site in 1987 and one UST was closed in place in 1993.  TPHms and BTEX were detected in  soil beneath the site during the UST removal.  Between 1990 and 1993 groundwater monitoring wells were installed beneath the site to evaluate the dissolved phase plume.  SPH was detected in onsite wells as recently as 2005, and significantly elevated levels of TPHms is present in soil throughout the site.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The subject site is one of seven sites with a co-mingled soil and groundwater contaminant plumes sites (Oakland National Engravers; RO0000079; Dunne Quality Paints; RO0000073; San Francisco French Bread Company; RO0000171; Celis Service Station; RO0000453; SNK Andante; RO0002530; Oak Walk; RO0002733, and Magnolia Terrace; RO0003004).  The groundwater contaminant plume extends a minimum distance of approximately 1,200 feet in length (see attached paleochannel figure).  The soil and groundwater plumes appear to have moved through a series of granular paleochannels (with significant interconnectivity) that is present beneath the sites.    The subject site appears to have been contributed contamination to all downgradient sites (San Francisco French Bread Company; RO0000171; Celis Service Station; RO0000453; SNK Andante; RO0002530; and Oak Walk; RO0002733).  The subject site, in addition to the adjacent Dunne Quality Paints site (RO0000073) appears to have contaminated groundwater beneath an innocent residential landowner (four Victorian homes; Ennis Properties) with free-phase concentrations of mineral spirits, and the adjacent Magnolia Terrace (RO0003004) with lower contaminant loads.  Free-phase remains in two wells that are offsite and no attempts to recover the product have been undertaken despite multiple requests.  Additionally the Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) reviewed the site at the request of the property owner’s representative and discovered multiple deficiencies in the scope of contaminant characterization DTSC would require to be investigated for use as a potential school site.  Included in this area of concern is the apparent discharge of solvents by a former furniture stripping company tenant to a drain line that appears to have been previously severed by the removal of an underground storage tank (however, additional contaminants also appear to require investigation).  Finally partly based on contaminant distribution, additional sources of contamination appear to be present beneath the site and buildings that have not been investigated.    A pilot test was approved in July 2010; however, a report has not been submitted despite multiple requests and extensions.  Multiple late letters and Notices of Violation have been issued; however, no progress has been made (December 16, 2010, and November 28, 2011).  Please refer to the electronic case file for these details.",

To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to various commercial configurations such as automobile sales. service, and repair operations with associated former USTs, waste oil USTs and hydraulic lifts.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil, soil vapor, and groundwater).  To address this contamination prior to development, additional subsurface investigation are required at the Site to delineate contamination and inform proposed corrective and remedial actions.

Between 2001 and 2005 eight events of overpurging of site wells occurred in an attempt to remove free phase and elevated concentrations.  In March 2012 bores B-1 to B-5 were installed in order to delineate the extent of waste oil contamination and free phase product around destroyed well MW-2.  In August 2012 soil bores B-6 to B-17, and B-22 were installed in preparation to delineate the water oil contamination for a remedial excavation.  Soil bores B-18 to B-21 were used to pre-profile the soil for offsite disposal.  The excavation was completed by November 2012.  In September 2012 a 10,000-gallon diesel UST and related equipment were removed from the site.  This UST had previously contained methanol.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently an operating gasoline service station located in a mixed commercial and residential area of Oakland, California.  This case was opened in response to the detection of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater samples collected during a Phase II Site Assessment in August 2008.  Five soil borings were advanced at the site on August 6, 2008 as part of a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment for due diligence.  TPHg was detected in one of the five soil samples collected at a concentration of 1.5 ppm; BTEX was not detected in any of the soil samples.   TPHg was detected in three of five grab groundwater samples collected at concentrations ranging from 180 to 3,600 ppb.  Benzene was detected in one of the grab groundwater samples (B-2) at a concentration of 17 ppb.      A historic fuel release occurred at the site sometime prior to 1989.  Site investigation activities including monitoring well installation were conducted at the site from 1989 through 1996.  The fuel leak case (RO000867 also referred to as StID#86 see attached Remedial Action Completion Certification and Case Closure Summary) was closed on April 30, 1998.    A 550-gallon waste oil tank was removed from the site on May 25, 2006.  A soil sample collected from the tank excavation contained 28 ppm oil and grease, 7.5 ppm TPHd, 62 ppm chromium, 11.6 ppm lead, 108 ppm nickel, and 48 ppm zinc.  An unauthorized release from was submitted on June 6, 2006.  However, based upon results from the tank removal and soil sampling, further investigation of the waste oil UST area was not warranted.    The only results from the August 2008 Phase II Environmental Site Assessment that exceeded Environmental Screening Levels (San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, May 2008) were the concentrations of TPHg and benzene in the grab groundwater sample from boring B-2.  Boring B-2 was located in approximately the same location as a previous monitoring well (MW-4), that was installed as part of site investigation activities conducted between 1989 and 1992 for the historic release.  Monitoring well MW-4 was sampled from July 1992 to January 1996.  During this period of groundwater monitoring for well MW-4, the concentration of TPHg ranged from less than 50 to 3,900 ppb and the concentration of benzene ranged from less than 0.5 to 210.  The grab groundwater sampling results from B-2 are within the range of historic sampling results from previous groundwater monitoring well MW-4.  Based on these results, the fuel hydrocarbons encountered in soil and groundwater from boring B-2 appear to be related to the historic release that was addressed under fuel leak case RO000867 aka StID #86, which was closed on April 30, 1998.  Therefore, current fuel leak case RO0002896 should be closed.",

October 21, 1988 one 1,000-gallon gasoline UST was removed.  100 yd3 was excavated and aerated during tank removal activities at the Corporation Yard.  Maximum concentrations of 16,327 mg\/kg TPHg and 204 mg\/kg benzene were detected in soil samples collected from beneath the UST.  Soil was reported to be aerated and reused as fill in other areas of the site.  On May 7, 1991, three monitoring wells were installed in the Corporation Yard area.    Another small fuel UST was removed from what is currently Mills Hall \/ Toyon Meadow.  TPHd was detected at concentrations of up to 6,300 ppm and 250 yd3 of soil were removed and went to a Class III landfill.  Subsequent sampling detected maximum concentrations of 11,000 mg\/kg TPHd.  Groundwater samples were not collected during this investigation.  One groundwater monitoring well was installed and sampled in 1990 with two additional monitoring wells installed in 1991.  The groundwater samples from the June 1991 Toyon Meadow monitoring event reported maximum TPHd concentration of 3,200 ug\/L.   Well MHW-1 was abandoned  after being damaged during site redevelopment and replaced with MWH-1A in May 1994.      A case file review performed by ACEH in 2013 indicated the Corporation Yard portion of the case met the LTCP.   One remaining data gap was identified for the Mills Hall \/ Toyon Meadow - potential impact to the nearby creek.  A groundwater assessment was performed in December 2013 to evaluate the meadow for migration of groundwater to the creek.  The assessment did not advance borings deep enough for recovery of grab groundwater samples and recovered soil samples in lieu of groundwater.  Maximum TPHd concentration of 6.95 mg\/kg was identified in the assessment indicating the creek was not impacted by the release of diesel fuel.  ACEH is of the opinion the case meets the LTCP criteria for closure.",

An SCP Case RO0003259 has been opened for the redevelopment of both parcels.  Remediation and corrective action activities for this LUST case were performed in 2020 in conjunction with ACDEH-approved corrective actions being implemented during site redevelopment under SCP Case RO0003259.  Corrective actions for petroleum hydrocarbons have included UST system removal, remedial soil excavation, groundwater remediation, and installation of vapor intrusion mitigation and migration engineering controls within the new building.  Off-site groundwater monitoring wells were installed in March 2022 and the results indicate low residual concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbon constituents in groundwater. Elevated petroleum constituents remain in soil vapor at the site however the risk to occupants of the building are mitigated through the installation of the VIMMECs. Thus ACDEH has listed the case as eligible for closure conditioned upon a second two more quarterly groundwater events n June and September 2022 to confirm groundwater concentrations.",

Please refer to the Case Closure Summary Form dated May 10, 2018 and the case file found on both Alameda County Department of Environmental Health website (http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm) and on GeoTracker.    Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Cleanup Site Case No. T0600100140\/RO0000129 was opened in 1993 by ACDEH to investigate and evaluate impacts to human health and the environment associated with an unauthorized release from three USTs and associated UST system components that were removed from the site in 1992.  Site investigation activities associated with the LUFT case were conducted from 1993 to 2017 to evaluate the extent of subsurface impacts to soil, soil vapor and groundwater from the UST system release.    This UST release case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH has determined that the site meets all the LTCP General Criteria and Media Specific Criteria and thus the site poses a low threat to human health and safety and to the environment under current and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios.  Other potential chemicals of concern from historic land use and operations at the site were not evaluated in association with this LUST case.    ACDEH recommends that during the environmental due diligence process (initiated as part of activities including, but not limited to, property transactions, bank refinancing, and redevelopment) that the site and parcels in the vicinity of the site be evaluated for risk from and exposure to potential chemicals of concern identified at this site.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is at the intersection of 28th Street and Telegraph Avenue in Oakland, CA and is currently occupied by a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant.  The surrounding area is a mixed residential and commercial area.  Shell demolished the former gasoline service station between 1988 and 1992.  The former service station consisted of a first generation underground storage tank (UST) in the northeast corner of the property, three second-generation gasoline USTs in the southwestern portion of the site, a waste oil tank, four dispensers, an oil\/water separator, three hydraulic lifts, and a station building.     Sometime in 1987, five soil borings were drilling and sampled in the vicinity of the three second generation USTs.  TPHg and benzene were detected in soil at concentrations up to 4,400 and 26 ppm, respectively.  TPHd and TPHmo were not detected in soil.    Three on-site groundwater monitoring wells (S-1, S-2, and S-3) were installed and sampled by Woodward-Clyde Consultants in April of 1988.  At that time, the service station was no longer in use and the single first generation UST had been removed from the northeastern corner of the site.  Maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene in soil were reported at 4,800 and 38 ppm, respectively.  Maximum concentrations of TPHg and benzene in the initial groundwater samples were 46,000 ppb and 2,700 ppb, respectively, reported in source area well S-3.  In November 1988, four off-site groundwater monitoring wells (S-4, S-5, S-6, and S-7) were installed.  TPHg and benzene were detected in groundwater from well S-6, which is located on the south side of 28th Street downgradient from the three gasoline USTs, at concentrations of 5,500 and 1,700 ppb, respectively.     In December 1988, the three gasoline, USTs, waste oil tank, dispensers, and product piping were removed.  The four tanks were made of fiberglass and no apparent holes or cracks were observed.  Soil samples collected from the sidewalls of the excavation contained TPHg and benzene at concentrations up to 2,800 and 0.85 ppm, respectively.  One soil sample collected below the waste oil UST did not contain reportable concentrations of TPHd and BTEX.  Overexcavation of the tank pit was performed on January 29, 1989.  The excavation was extended vertically to a depth of approximately 9.5 feet below grade where groundwater was encountered.  Approximately 500 cubic yards of soil was excavated from the area around the tank pit in the southwestern portion of the site.        In July 1989, three additional off-site monitoring wells (S-8, S-9, and S-10) were installed south of the site.  Off-site monitoring well S-11 and on-site product recovery well SR-1 were installed in October and November 1990.  On-site soil vapor extraction wells SV-1 and SV-2 were installed on September 11, 1991.  GeoStrategies, Inc. conducted a soil vapor extraction pilot test using wells SV-1 and SV-2 on September 24, 1991.  The vapor extraction test results indicated minimal vacuum influence and low vapor recovery concentrations.  GeoStrategies, Inc. concluded that soil vapor extraction was not a feasible remedial alternative for the site.      Between 1991 and June 1992, the former service station building, the dispenser island, and dispenser canopy were removed.  From June through August 1992, GeoStrategies, Inc. observed the removal of the oil water separator and three hydraulic lifts formerly located within the service station building and collected soil samples beneath the former OWS, hydraulic lifts, and former dispensers.  TPHg and BTEX were not reported in any of the four soil samples collected beneath the product piping at each dispenser.  One soil sample collected below the OWS contained oil and grease at a concentration of 68 ppm and did not contain reportable concentrations of TPHg, TPHd, or BTEX.  The excavation was expanded laterally and vertically in the area of the former OWS.  After the second stage of excavation, a confirmation soil sample collected from the bottom of the excavation at a depth of approximately 10.5 to 11 feet bgs did not contain TPHg, TPHd, oil and grease, or BTEX at concentrations above reporting limits.  Three soil samples were collected beneath each of the former hydraulic lifts at 7.5 to 8 feet bgs.  TPHd and TPHmo were detected at concentrations of 40 and 580 ppm, respectively, in one of the three soil samples (SL-1) but were below detection limits in the other two soil samples.  Two phases of additional soil excavation were conducted in the area of sample SL-1.  The confirmation sample collected from the bottom of the excavation at a depth of approximately 10.5 to 11 feet bgs did not contain detectable concentrations of TPHd or TPHmo.  The overexcavation performed in the vicinity of the former OWS and hydraulic lifts removed approximately 90 cubic yards of soil.    Off-site monitoring wells S-7, S-9, and S-11 were decommissioned on November 19, 1999 to accommodate development of the off-site parcel.  A sensitive receptor survey, utility conduit survey, and request for case closure were submitted on June 4, 2001.      In response to an ACEH request, three on-site borings were proposed in the vicinity of former downgradient well S-3 and five offsite borings were proposed along the Telegraph Avenue to determine whether petroleum hydrocarbons were migrating along the utility corridors.  Due to numerous utilities beneath Telegraph Avenue, Cambria was unable to find locations for the five proposed offsite borings.  Onsite borings were advanced in May 2004 in the source area near former well S-3.  TPHg was detected in soil samples from the borings at concentrations up to 4,900 ppm.  Benzene, MTBE, EDB, and EDC were not detected in the soil samples.  Grab groundwater samples collected from each of the three borings contained TPHg at concentrations up to 86,000 ppb.  Benzene, MTBE, EDB, EDC, and other fuel oxygenates were not detected in the grab groundwater samples.     Onsite wells S-1 and SR-1 and off-site wells S-4, S-5, and S-10 were decommissioned on November 11, 2005.  A geophysical survey was used to find “missing” well S-3, which was located in a planter along 28th Street.  Well S-3 was filled with debris and was properly decommissioned in March 2006.  Replacement well S-3R was installed downgradient from the former USTs in March 2006.    Groundwater monitoring has been conducted at the site since May 1988.  Free product was historically observed and measured in onsite well S-3 between October 1990 and July 1991.  Maximum historical concentrations of TPHg, benzene, and MTBE in groundwater were 47,000 ppb (S-3), 3,700 ppb (offsite well S-6), and 229 ppb (offsite well S-8).  During recent groundwater monitoring events, only source well S-3R, and downgradient wells S-6, and S-8 are monitored quarterly.  During the most recent Second Quarter 2008 groundwater sampling event on May 28, 2008, groundwater from wells S-3R, S-6, and S-8 contained 450, 1,400, and 1,200 ppb of TPHg, respectively.  Benzene was reported in groundwater only from well S-6 at a concentration of 2 ppb and MTBE was below detection limits in all three wells.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The subject property includes four addresses; 750 50th Avenue and 5050, 5051 and 5020 Coliseum Way in Oakland. Site industrial uses began in about 1876, continuing through 1963 for ore smelting and lead extraction, and manufacturing of acids and paint products. A lithopone manufacturing facility, owned and operated by Glidden and others, occupied the properties at 750-50th Avenue and 5050 Coliseum Way from 1926 to 1963.  Lithopone consists of a chemically co-precipitated pigment of barium sulfate and zinc sulfate used in the production of paint pigment. Various metals such as cadmium, selenium, and titanium were added to the lithopone to give it pigment. Wastes generated in this process were disposed on-site and on the adjacent 5051 and 5200 Coliseum Way properties.    A localized soluble metals plume has been identified in acidic groundwater beneath the central and western portion of the 5050 property. This degradation is primarily attributed to the former on-site disposal of sulfide rich ores and slag from the historical smelting of ore, the manufacture of sulfuric acid and other possible industrial wastes. Primary groundwater contaminants of concern are zinc and cadmium.  A sheet pile groundwater diversion barrier was constructed adjacent to the concrete channel of Peralta Creek in November 2001. Weep water holes located within Peralta Creek and are sampled annually with the groundwater monitoring network to monitor off-site discharges of metals.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    TPHg was detected in a soil sample from the UST tank pit collected following removal of the UST at a concentration of 680 mg\/kg, and in a stockpile soil sample at a concentration of  less than 100 mg\/kg. Benzene was detected at a concentration of 11 mg\/kg at the bottom of the tank pit.    Site investigations were conducted from 1988 to 2006 to evaluate the extent of subsurface impacts both onsite and offsite to soil and groundwater from the fuel release.  Groundwater samples were collected from an onsite groundwater monitoring well (MT\/W-1) in 1988, 1992 and 2006 and an onsite boring (MT\/B-1) in 1991.  Soil samples were collected from two onsite borings (MW-1 and MT\/B-1 and five offsite borings (B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, and B-5) advanced in 1991 immediately downgradient of the property and release by Cal-Trans during the I-880 realignment project.  Soil bores B-1 to B-3 are considered downgradient of the release, and soil bores B-4 and B-5 are considered crossgradient from the release.    No remediation other than the UST removal and excavation of the tank pit has  been conducted.    This UST release case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH has determined that the site meets all the LTCP General and the Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater.     The site does not meet the Media Specific Criteria for Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air and the Media Specific Criteria for Direct Contact. However, based on an analysis of site specific conditions a determination has been made that the residual contamination in soil and groundwater at the site poses a low threat to human health and safety and to the environment under current and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios,.    Refer to Attachments 4 through 7 in the closure summary for detailed information on the LTCP evaluation.",

Soil samples collected from the bottom and sidewalls of the excavations contained up to 10,000 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) of total petroleum hydrocarbons as motor oil (TPHmo).  In March 1993, four of the reservoir pits and one hoist pit were over-excavated in an attempt to remove residual contamination.  At the completion of the over-excavation for pits H-5, T-1\/T2, and T-5, verification soil samples were collected from the bottom and sidewalls of the excavations.  The 8 verification soil samples did not contain total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd) or TPHmo at concentrations above reporting limits.  Due to presence of a column foundation, the excavation in the area of reservoir pit T3\/T4 could not be extended below a depth of 8 feet below the building floor even though stained soil was visible at the bottom of the excavation.  Two additional soil samples collected below the base of the excavation at depths of 12 and 13 feet below the building floor, contained 19,000 and 22,000 mg\/kg of TPHmo, respectively.      On September 15, 1993, one soil boring was advanced at T3\/T4 and one boring was advanced south of T3\/T4 to assess the vertical extent of contamination.  A soil sample collected from the boring within T3\/T4 at a depth of 13 feet contained 0.6 mg\/kg of TPHmo.  A groundwater sample collected from a depth of approximately 35 feet from the boring within T3\/T4 contained 4,800 micrograms per liter of TPHmo.  TPHmo was not detected at concentrations above the reporting limit in the soil sample collected at a depth of 13 feet from the downgradient location.  TPHd was not detected at concentrations above the reporting limits in the two soil samples and one groundwater sample collected.    Additional soil and groundwater samples were collected in April 2013.  Low concentrations of TPHmo were detected in soil and groundwater samples.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    UST removed from the site.  Tank Removal Report indicates minor TPH impact to soil.  A total of three soil samples were taken during the May 1985 UST removal: one beneath each of the two USTs and one below the product piping.  Each soil sample was analyzed only for the volatile organic compounds (VOCs): benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX).  Benzene was detected in all three soil samples, up to a maximum of 0.47 mg\/kg, exceeding the benzene residential and commercial Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) of 0.044 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) (San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, Table A ESLs for Shallow Soil, Groundwater is Current or Potential Source of Drinking Water, December 2013).  Toluene and total xylenes detections for the UST samples were less than the ESLs.  Xylenes were detected in the product piping soil sample up to 26 mg\/kg exceeding the ESL of 2.3 mg\/kg.    Depth to groundwater ranged from approximately 2.9 to 8.6 feet below ground surface (bgs) in groundwater monitoring wells at neighboring Fuel Leak Case RO0003066.  During the UST removal, groundwater was observed at 95 inches (7.9 feet) bgs and rising in the UST pit.  Similarly, during the UST removal at neighboring Fuel Leak Case RO0003066, groundwater was observed in the UST pit at 11 feet bgs.  Holes were observed in the product piping, but the USTs appeared to be intact and no odors or sheen were observed in the UST pit water.  The primary source (two USTs and product piping) was removed and impacted soils aerated onsite for two weeks to reduce potential concentrations.   MTBE was not an analyte during the UST removal.  However, analytical results from three groundwater monitoring wells at neighboring downgradient Fuel Leak Case RO0003066, 330 feet southwest of the site, were historically non-detect for TPHg, BTEX, and MTBE, suggesting a lack of impact from a potential contaminant plume emanating from RO0003045.    The UST and product piping removal (source removal), the lack of VOCs detected during the source removal, the onsite aeration of backfill, and the lack of downgradient off-site impact to neighboring Fuel Leak Case RO0003066 are lines of evidence that support probable low residual source mass and low potential impact to groundwater and vapor intrusion to indoor air.  The primary source (two USTs and product piping) was removed and excavated backfill was aerated onsite for two weeks to reduce potential concentrations prior to use as UST backfill in addition with clean fill material.  Volatiles (benzene, toluene, and xylenes) in the three soil samples do not support the presence of a source mass with adequate magnitude or lateral extent to suspect a vapor intrusion risk.  Ethylbenzene was not analyzed in soil for the tank removal. Ethylbenzene concentrations theoretically would be less than benzene concentrations based on average weight percent composition of gasoline. The State Water Resource Control Board’s Leaking Underground Fuel Tank Guidance Manual CA LUFT (September 2012) indicates that fresh gasoline contains an average of 1.7% by weight of ethylbenzene and an average of 2.0% by weight of benzene.  Because benzene concentrations did not exceed the LTCP Table 1 Criteria, it is expected that ethylbenzene concentrations, if present, would similarly not exceed the LTCP Table 1 Criteria.  Naphthalene was not included in the analysis of soil samples collected at the site. This apparent data gap can be addressed using the published relative concentrations of naphthalene and benzene in gasoline. This approach has been used by SWRCB staff in recent Closure Orders pursuant to the Policy (e.g., SWRCB WQ Order 2013-0003): Gasoline mixtures contain an average of approximately 2% benzene and 0.25% naphthalene (Potter and Simmons 1998); therefore, benzene concentrations can be directly substituted for naphthalene concentrations with a safety factor of about 10. The maximum benzene concentrations from the Site are less than the naphthalene criteria in Table 1 of the Policy. Therefore, the estimated naphthalene concentrations at the Site meet the Policy criteria for direct contact by a factor of about 10. It is highly unlikely that naphthalene concentrations in the soil, if any, exceed the Policy criteria. Soil samples were not analyzed for PAHs as there was no waste oil UST.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for this fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/aceh\/lop\/ust.htm.  Please copy and paste this link into your browser to access the ACDEH website.    This site has two Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) regulatory oversight program cases associated with it:  (1) Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Case No. RO0002905 for petroleum hydrocarbon contamination, and (2) Site Cleanup Program (SCP) Case No. RO0003180 for non-petroleum contamination.    The LUST Case No. RO0002905 has been closed as a low risk site in accordance with the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (LTCP).  ACDEH must be notified if any changes in land use or site redevelopment is proposed.  Preparation and submittal of a Site Management Plan (SMP) for ACDEH review and approval is required prior to any site redevelopment which may involve repair or maintenance activity, site improvements that include modifications to the foundation, subsurface utilities and\/or hardscape or subsurface work,  of existing site improvements in areas of residual contamination, and\/or permitting of any proposed site redevelopment including a change in land use to residential, or other conservative land use.       Current Land-use at time of Closure:  The site is located on the north corner of the intersection of 77th Avenue and Spencer Street in Oakland, California.  The property consists of one parcel having the Assessor’s Parcel Number of 41-4142-38 and the physical address of 1001 77th Avenue.  Site development consists of one single-story building with associated paved and un-paved areas.  The most recent reported use of the building was for storage.      Adjacent Property(ies) Land-use at Time of Closure:  The site is located is a mixed use neighborhood consisting of generally residential properties to the northwest of 77th Avenue and industrial properties to the southeast of 77th Avenue.  Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in groundwater appears to be limited to the immediate vicinity of the site to the south-southeast and extends beneath 77th Avenue.  Based on the groundwater monitoring well data from the well network, contamination does not extend across 77th Avenue.  However, should off-site redevelopment occur, ACDEH recommends evaluating the redevelopment site(s) for chemicals of concern identified on this site.      Historic Land-use \/ Site Investigation:  Historic site use includes a gas and oil station with auto repair since at least 1951 through the 1960s and followed with use as an auto repair facility through the mid-1980s.  At the time this case was opened in 2005, the site was used for material storage by a local church doing business as Acts Community Development.     A site investigation was performed in 2005 following the recommendations of an environmental transaction screen.  Though the presence of an underground storage tank (UST) pit was identified at the site, no USTs were located within the pit.  The investigation included the collection of soil and grab-groundwater samples from two on-site soil bores.  Laboratory analysis indicated groundwater contained petroleum hydrocarbon contamination.  Three additional investigations were performed, including the installation of on- and off-site groundwater monitoring wells.  Based on the data collected from these investigations, it was determined that the petroleum hydrocarbon contaminant plume was defined by the off-site wells and the case met the closure criteria established in the LTCP.     Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern:  Potential chemicals of concern (PCOCs) identified for the site include the fuel related petroleum hydrocarbons compounds gasoline, diesel, and motor oil; benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (collectively known as BTEX);  methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and the wear (LUFT) metals.  Additionally, chlorinated hydrocarbons were identified by site investigations and include tetrachloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE), and vinyl chloride (VC).   The non petroleum hydrocarbon contamination is address in the SCP case RO0003180 and is not part of the closure of this case.       Remediation Activities:  Remedial activities performed at the site include the excavation of soil from the former UST pit and water infiltrating into the excavation.  A total of 128 tons of soil and 6,000 gallons of water were removed and disposed off-site.      Case Closure &amp; Future Site Management Requirements:  This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  In addition, chlorinated solvents have been identified in groundwater beneath the site.  A separate case, ACDEH case file RO0003180, has been opened to address the chlorinated solvent contamination.      Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.",

The area of concern is the former Young's Cleaners on the north side of the site.  Between 1988 and 1997, a total of 12 monitoring wells, 22 soil borings, and several cone penetrometer borings were advanced at and near the site to investigate the extent of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soil and groundwater.  Between October 1995 and January 1996, approximately 2,500 cubic yards of soil containing PCE was excavated from beneath Young's Cleaners and adjacent tenant spaces and around the sanitary sewer.  Two additional soil borings and 17 soil gas probes were completed in October 2006 to investigate soil vapor conditions at the site.  Based on these data, ACEH requested site remediation to reduce the potential for vapor intrusion.  Additional soil vapor investigation was completed in June 2007 to help design the remedial approach.     Although a large volume of soil impacted by VOCs has been removed from the site, residual contamination appears to remain in the vicinity of the former Young's Cleaners.  Horizontal extraction piping, a sub-slab depressurization system, and soil vapor extraction system were installed and began operation in January 2014.     An upgraded remedial system has been proposed and, subject to public comment, will be installed and operated at the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The property operated as an express courier facility (Modern Mail Services, Inc.) between 1951 and 2003.  One 10,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tank (UST) was installed in the late 1970s and removed in 1998.  The site is located in a mixed commercial residential area and currently contains a vacant structure.  Cars are parked on this lot occasionally to make it appear occupied.        On July 14, 1998, Golden Gate Tank Removal removed the 10,000-gallon gasoline UST.  The tank appeared to be intact yet floating product was observed on the tank pit water.  Because the water in the tank pit contained floating product, the accumulated water was removed from the tank pit before sampling.  Soil samples were collected from the east and west sidewalls from a depth of 8.5 feet below grade, and one water sample was collected from the tank pit water.  One soil sample was collected from beneath the dispenser.  The maximum detected concentrations in soil during this sample event were detected from the dispenser sample at concentrations of 2,100 mg\/kg TPHg, and 2.8 mg\/kg benzene.  The water sample contained 4,200 micrograms per liter (µg\/L) TPHg, 15 µg\/L benzene and 150 µg\/L MTBE.      On November 22, 2005, Stellar Environmental Solutions advanced four soil borings at the site.  Maximum concentrations were 920 ppm TPHg, 1.8 ppm benzene and 0.024 ppm MTBE in soil.  Maximum concentrations in groundwater were 430,000 ppb TVHg, 6,700 ppb benzene and 24 ppb MTBE.    On April 3, 2006, Stellar Environmental Solutions advanced nine exploratory boreholes (BH-5 to BH-13) to determine the lateral and vertical extent of soil and groundwater contamination.  Maximum soil concentrations were detected in BH-8 at concentrations of 5,300 ppm TVHg, 0.67 ppm benzene and 0.22 ppm MTBE.  Maximum groundwater concentrations were also detected in BH-8 at 120,000 ppb TVHg, 1,200 ppb benzene, and 120 ppb MTBE.    On September 25 and 26, 2006, five monitoring well pairs (MW-1A, MW-1B through MW-5A, MW-5B) were installed, and one soil boring (BH-14) was advanced.  Maximum concentrations in soil were 790 ppm TVHg, and 0.031 ppm MTBE.  No benzene was detected in soil.  Maximum groundwater concentrations were 1,900 ppb TVHg, 9.6 ppb benzene and 37 ppb MTBE.      On October 3, 2006, Stellar oversaw excavation of approximately 397.6 tons of contaminated soil.  In addition, 5,100 gallons of contaminated groundwater were pumped from the excavation pit.  Soil samples collected from the sidewalls contained maximum concentrations of 1,700 ppm TVHg, indicating that some residual contamination remained in place near the building adjacent to the service bay.   Samples collected from the bottom of the excavation were all below the detection limit.  Advanced Oxygen Reducing Compound (ORC™) product was placed into the open excavation prior to backfilling and a perforated PVC pipe was placed in drain rock from 6 to 11 feet bgs to be used as a dewatering point.      On November 27, 2007, the building containing the service bay was removed and the soil beneath was excavated to a depth of approximately 10.5 ft bgs with 212.6 tons of soil removed.  Approximately 4,500 gallons of groundwater were removed from the excavation and 375 pounds of ORC were applied to the excavation during backfilling.  Soil samples collected from the sidewalls and floor detected maximum concentrations of 4.7 ppm TVHg.  No BTEX or oxygenates were detected in these samples.    December 2008, Stellar submitted a Preferential Pathway Utility and Well Survey.  One water supply well is located within a half mile radius of the site.  This well is listed as a public well and is located to the north of the site.  Since this well is located in the cross-gradient direction it is unlikely to be impacted due to the distance from the site and the low concentrations at the site.      In September 2010, Stellar Environmental injected ORC™ into the subsurface in the area near MW-3A, MW-3B, MW-4B, and MW 1B.      The site wells have been monitored quarterly from October 2006 to April 2009 and semiannually since October 2009 through the second half of 2011.  Contaminant concentrations have declined significantly on-site with maximum concentrations of 110 ppb TVHg, 0.98 ppb benzene and 58 ppb MTBE.      If any construction\/excavation activities encounter contamination that is indicative of higher residual concentrations than reported in this closure summary's \"After\" columns of te \"Maximum Documented Contaminant Concentrations\" table, then ACEH must be immediately notified.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The site is currently used by the City of Oakland as a corporation yard. The case file and 1990 tank removal permit documents include maps showing plans for removing four fuel USTs one 2,000 gall regular fuel, one 300 gallon diesel, and two other older and smaller tanks with unknown contents), a pump house with fuel dispensers inside, and a kerosene building and installation of above ground tanks.  However, tank removal inspection forms dated May 1990 indicate  that  two tanks were observed in separate excavations in the tank hold area (one 2,000 gallon gasoline and one 550-gallon diesel).  The tanks were reportedly tar coated and had no holes. Samples were reportedly collected from 3 to 4 feet beneath each of the tanks (due to deep sand backfill) and beneath pipelines and no groundwater was encountered in either UST excavation. Native material is reported as a coarse-grained mixture of clay, silt and cobbles. Soil in one end of the gas UST pit was reported to be black and had a noticeable odor of aged gasoline. Two samples were reportedly collected from beneath the gas UST and one sample was collected beneath the diesel UST. The notes report that the diesel tank pit appeared to be backfilled on top of bedrock (shale) and the sample collected was mostly sand. The notes also report that pipelines were pulled out and samples taken from beneath each.    The case file does not contain a tank removal report however does contain analytical data which indicates that 12 depth discrete sample and 4 composite sample were collected and submitted for laboratory analysis during the tank removal in May 1990, however there are no maps in the file showing the location of the samples or rationale for selected sample location or analysis. 2 samples (1A1 and 1A2) were collected at a depth of 11 feet bgs and analyzed for TPH and BTEX, 1 sample (1A3) was collected at a depth of 8 feet bgs and analyzed for TPHd and TPH-O&amp;G, 2 samples were collected at a depth of 7.5 feet bgs (1B1 and 1B2) and analyzed for TPHd, 2 samples were collected from a depth of 9.5 feet bgs (1B3 and 1B4) and analyzed for TPHd, 2 samples (1C1 and 1C2) were collected ata depth of 8 feet bgs and analyzed for TPH and BTEX, 1 sample collected at a depth of 3 feet bgs (1A5) was analyzed for TPH, 1 sample collected at a depth of 3 feet bgs (1A4) was analyzed for TPHd and TPH-O&amp;G, 1 sample collected at a depth of 2 feet bgs was analyzed for TPH and BTEX, one composite sample (Composite A) was analyzed for TPH), one composite sample (Composite B was analyzed for TPHd and TPH-O&amp;G, one composite sample (C) was analyzed for TPH and BTEX) and one composite sample (1C4-Comp) was analyzed for TPH, TPHd, and BTEX.    TPH was detected above the method detection limit of 10 mg\/kg in six samples including the two samples (1A1 and 1A2) collected at 11 feet bgs, sample 1A3 collected at 8 feet bgs, sample 1A4 collected at 3 feet bgs, and two composite samples (Composite B and Composite C) at concentrations ranging from 24 mg\/kg to   2200 mg\/kg. TPHd was detected above the method detection limit of 10 mg\/kg in 7 samples including sample 1A3 collected at 8 feet bgs, 1A4, 1B1 and 1B2 collected at 7.5 feet bgs, and composite samples (Composite B and 1C4 Comp) at concentrations ranging from 62 mg\/kg to 1400 mg\/kg. TPH-O&amp;G was detected above the method detection limit of 10 mg\/kg in 3 samples including sample 1A3 collected at 8 feet bgs, 1A4 collected at 3 feet bgs, and Composite B at concentrations ranging from 24 mg\/kg to 2200 mg\/kg. BTEX compounds were detected above the method detection limit of 1 mg\/kg in 4 samples including samples 1A1 and 1A2 collected at 11 feet bgs, and composite samples (Composite C and 1C4-Comp) at concentrations ranging from 6 to 27 mg\/kg benzene, 4.2 to 86 mg\/kg toluene, 2.4 to 16 ethylbenzene, and 12 to 150 mg\/kg xylenes.      The UST Unauthorized Release form in the file indicates the source of the release was from tank overfilling and a pipe leak at the dispenser however there is no additional information in the case files. In April 1999, a magnetometer survey was conducted in the vicinity of the former USTs to confirm that no other USTs were present, which detected no anomalies. In March 1999, a boring (SC1) was installed to a depth of approximately 23 feet bgs in the vicinity of the  in the vicinity of the gasoline UST excavation. Results of a grab groundwater sample collected from the boring indicated that the shallow groundwater was impacted with low concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons (140 ug\/L TPHg, 150 ug\/L TPHd, 12 ug\/L benzene, 1.8 ug\/l toluene, 4.0 ug\/l ethylbenzene, 6.9 ug\/l xylenes,  &lt;2 ug\/l MTBE). TPHd and TPHmo were detected in samples collected from the boring at depths of 13.5 and 19 feet bgs at concentrations of 21 mg\/kg and 15 mg\/kg, respectively. Between April and November 1999, a monitoring well (MW-1) was reportedly installed within 10 feet of the former UST location. Fractured siltstone bedrock was encountered in at approximately 8 to 19 feet bgs in the borehole MW-1 and SC-2, respectively. The depth to groundwater in MW-1 ranged from 14 to 19 feet bgs.     In January 2011 two borings were advanced to 25 feet bgs (B-1) and 38 feet  bgs (B-2) at locations reported as topographically downgradient of the UST pits. Groundwater was encountered in boring B-1 at a depth of approximately 23 feet bgs; no groundwater was encountered in boring B-2. Soil samples collected form 9.5 feet bgs in B-1 and 24 feet bgs in B-2, and a grab groundwater sample collected from B-1 were analyzed for TPHg, TPHd, TPHmo, BTEX, MTBE, naphthalene, and lead scavengers. With the exception of 4.2 mg\/kg  TPHd in B-1, no other analytes were detected in the soil and groundwater samples above the laboratory reporting limits. The depth to water in well MW-1 was approximately 14 feet bgs. With the exception of 0.66 ug\/L benzene, no other analytes were detected above laboratory reporting limits (MTBE RL = 20 ug\/L) in a sample collected from well MW-1.    In April 2014 a site conceptual model was submitted and requested closure under the Low Threat Closure Policy.  A positive response was provided on August 27, 2014.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is located at 2500 Poplar Street in Oakland, California.  The site is situated on the southern site of 26th Street between Poplar and Union Streets in Oakland.  The site has been historically operated as a truck maintenance, fueling, and dispatch facility.      On August 2, 1994, CNC Services of Antioch, California removed three underground storage tanks (USTs) from two excavations at the site, consisting of one 1,000-gallon and two 4,000-gallon single-walled steel tanks.  According to Matheson Trucking, none of the USTs were used by them and were already in-place prior to their occupancy in 1972.  It is assumed that the USTs stored either gasoline or diesel fuel.  Soil sample analytical results detected concentrations of TPH-d up to 44 mg\/kg and TPH-g at concentrations up to 1,360 mg\/kg in soil sample West Tank #4.  Benzene was detected above the laboratory reporting limit of &lt;0.15 mg\/kg in soil sample West Tank #4.  Groundwater sample analytical results detected TPH-d, TPH-g, and benzene at concentrations of 140 µg\/L, 60 µg\/L, and &lt;0.3 µg\/L, respectively.      On January 29, 1996, Hageman-Aguiar, Inc. installed two shallow groundwater monitoring wells, MW-1 and MW-2, in the vicinity of the former UST excavations.  During the last two quarters in September 1997, gasoline and diesel range hydrocarbons were not detected above the laboratory detection limit in the groundwater samples collected from the monitoring wells.       On September 27, 1999, Eureka Builders of Carson City, Nevada, removed four USTs from a common excavation located at the site.  The tanks consisted of one 7,000-gallon diesel, one 4,000-gallon diesel, one 4,000-gallon gasoline, one 550-gallon waste oil UST.  Soil sample analytical results detected TPH-g, TPH-d, TPH-mo, TOG, and benzene at concentrations of 73 mg\/kg, 760 mg\/kg, 2,000 mg\/kg, 1,600 mg\/kg, and 0.77 mg\/kg, respectively.  A groundwater sample collected from the excavation pit detected TPH-g, TPH-d, TPH-mo, benzene, and MTBE at concentrations 890 µg\/L, 3,900 µg\/L, 1,600 µg\/L, 2.2 µg\/L, and &lt;5.0 µg\/L, respectively.        On April 18, 2000, two groundwater monitoring wells (MW-3 and MW-4) were installed at the site.   Soil sample analytical results detected TPH-mo at a concentration 220 mg\/kg.  Groundwater sample analytical results, collected on August 6, 2009, detected TPH-d at a concentration of 500 µg\/L in a groundwater sample collected from MW-4.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site consists of a locomotive fueling facility located in the southeast area of a 185-acre active rail yard.  The case was opened in May 2018 due to significant soil staining observed around the fuel pad slated for replacement.  Prior to the fueling pad replacement activities, a soil vapor survey was conducted in March through May 2019 for four buildings in the vicinity of the fueling pad- the UPRR Police Office Building, Diesel Shop Office, Office Building Next to Tower and the 1408 Middle Harbor Road Office Building.  Two soil vapor probes were installed at the outside perimeter of each building. Soil samples were collected  from the base of each probe for secondary line of evidence along with the soil vapor samples.    Soils samples were reported to contain extractable range petroleum hydrocarbons at up to 294 mg\/kg TPHd and 1,400 mg\/kg TPHmo.  Concentrations of TPHg and full-scan TM 8260 for VOCs were reported below the laboratory reporting limit.  Soil vapor samples were reported to contain volatile range petroleum hydrocarbons and numerous VOCs including PCE, TCE, DCE, VC, and acetone.  Maximum PCE, TCE, and VC concentrations were reported at 76 ug\/m3, 13 ug\/m3, and 260 ug\/m3, respectively.     The fueling facility upgrades included removal and replacement of the existing approximately 260-foot long concrete fueling platform and and tracks on either side of the locomotive fueling platform.   Proposed work included excavation of soil to approximately 4 feet below ground surface (bgs), backfill the excavation with engineered fill, replacing the concrete fueling platform and installing new piping for relocated fuel cranes.  Between June 4 and October 30, 2018, the existing locomotive fueling pad was demolished and excavation of approximately 3,065 tons of soil to approximately 4 feet bgs. Groundwater was not encountered during the excavation.  Excavated soil and concrete were segregated and stockpiled separately, on and covered by visqueen, for characterization.  Soil was transported offsite by rail gondolas and disposed of at ECDC Environmental LLC (ECDC) landfill, located in East Carbon, Utah, as both nonhazardous and non-Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste. The last gondola was transported offsite on June 6, 2019.  Of the approximately 3,065 tons of soil  transported to ECDC, approximately 1,416 tons of soil were disposed of as nonhazardous waste and approximately 1,649 tons of soil were disposed of as non-RCRA hazardous waste.  Concrete was transported offsite and disposed of at Bay Area Concrete Recycling in Union City, California as non-hazardous (and managed for recycling). The last truck was transported offsite on June 29, 2019.    Excavation sidewall and base samples were collected and analyzed for TPHd, TPHmo and PAHs.  Residual concentrations of TPHd and TPHmo were reported up to 65,000 mg\/kg and 15,000 mg\/kg, respectively.  Numerous PAHs were detected with a maximum concentration benzo(a)pyrene of 0.41 mg\/kg and 29 mg\/kg for naphthalene.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is an active gas station in a mixed use residential neighborhood and has operated as a gasoline service station since the early 1970's.  In August 1990, KEI conducted soil sampling during routine dispenser modifications and upgrades. Three soil samples (D1 through D3) were collected from beneath product dispensers and four soil samples (PT-1 through PT-4) were collected from product pipe trenches.  Concentrations of TPH-G and BTEX were detected in soil sample PT-3, from the pipeline trench that supplied the northern dispenser island.  The case was opened in 1992 following contamination observed during fueling system upgrades.  Subsurface investigations confirming the presence of subsurface petroleum hydrocarbon contamination.  Investigations conducted though the present day include construction of on- and off-site groundwater monitoring wells, with light non-aqueous phase petroleum hydrocarbons (LNAPL) identified as extending off site.      History of site operations and investigations include the 1972 installation of three steel USTs (one 12,000-gallon, one 8,000-gallon, and one 5,000 gallon). In March 1986, the USTs failed a tank tightness test. During the removal of the leaking USTs in April 1986, Kaprealian Engineering, Inc. (KEI) conducted a UST inspection and soil sampling.  Seven soil samples were obtained from beneath the USTs and analyzed for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons in the gasoline range (TPH-G). Concentrations of TPH-G were detected in five of the samples. Approximately 150 cubic yards of soil were disposed at a Class III landfill, however, no evidence of excavation or excavated soil analysis was found in the records. The three USTs were subsequently replaced with one 12,000-gallon and two 10,000-gallon double-walled fiberglass USTs. In July 1986, KEI installed 3 onsite groundwater monitoring wells  (MW-1, MW-2, &amp; MW-3).  From October 1986 to February 1989, KEI performed monthly monitoring and quarterly analysis of groundwater samples collected from  MW-1, MW-2, and MW-3 for TPH-G and Benzene, Ethylbenzene, Toluene, and Total Xylenes (BTEX). The highest concentration of both TPH-G and BTEX were detected in samples collected from well MW-1, near the southeast corner of the UST complex. LNAPL was reported in wells MW-1 and MW-2 and sheen in MW-3.     In 1989 BP acquired the station from Mobil Oil Company. In February 1990, an additional investigation consisting of the installation of 10 borings (located both onsite and offsite) was conducted by Alton Geoscience. The borings were converted into temporary wells (TW-1 through TW-10). The highest concentrations of TPH-G and BTEX were detected in temporary well TW-5 (located off-site to the southwest within 35th Avenue) and well TW-10 (located near the northwest corner of the UST complex). Groundwater samples from MW-1 and TW-2 were not analyzed due to the presence of FP. Groundwater flow direction beneath the site was toward the southwest at the time of the investigation. In February 1990, Alton drilled two onsite borings that were converted into one 2-inch diameter groundwater monitoring well (MW-4) and one 6-inch diameter recovery well (RW-1). Alton also installed three off-site groundwater monitoring wells  (MW-5, MW-6, &amp; MW-7). Off-site monitoring well MW-5 the most down-gradient off-site monitoring well had the highest concentrations of TPH-G, and BTEX in both soil and groundwater samples. At the time of the investigation the groundwater elevation data indicated a southerly groundwater flow direction. Alton noted that well MW-5 is located approximately ten feet from the Quik Stop's UST complex and that the distribution of contaminants in soil is indicative of close-proximity release (e.g. Quik Stop).    In August 1990, KEI conducted soil sampling during routine dispenser modifications and upgrades. Three soil samples (D1 through D3) were collected from beneath product dispensers and four soil samples (PT-1 through PT-4) were collected from product pipetrenches.  Concentrations of TPH-G and BTEX were detected in soil sample PT-3, from the pipeline trench that supplied the northern dispenser island. Approximately 150 cubic yards of soil was disposed of at an approved Class III disposal facility. In February 1991, Alton drilled three off-site borings (SB-8, SB-9, SB-10), which were converted to groundwater monitoring wells MW-8, MW-9, &amp; MW-10.  The highest concentrations of TPH-G and BTEX were detected in MW-8. At the time of the investigation, a southeasterly groundwater flow direction was reported. A pumping test was also conducted to estimate aquifer parameters. From 1992 to September 1995 a groundwater extraction system was operated as an interim remedial action to recover FP from recovery well RW-1 and extract and treat groundwater at an onsite treatment system using granular activated carbon, which operated system periodically until September 28, 1995.  The System extracted approximately 884,459 gallons of water.   FP has been routinely removed by hand bailing from monitoring wells MW-1 and MW-2 and recovery well RW-1 as an interim remedial action. In April 2004, URS advanced off-site soil bores, UB-1 through UB-6, and  six on-site soil borings (UB-7 through UB-12) and collected soil samples for analysis of Gasoline-Range Organics (GRO), BTEX, and MTBE.  In November 2008, Stratus conducted a mobile Dual Phase Extraction (DPE) pilot test utilizing wells MW-1, MW-2, and RW-1 as extraction wells.  Based on the test results, Stratus concluded DPE does not appear to be an optimal remedial technology for the site.     Off-site monitoring well MW-10, located across 35th Ave., has either had free product (FP) or demonstrated FP concentrations since 1994.  The well was destroyed in February 2016 and replaced with MW-10R.  Well MW-10R initially contained TPH-G at FP concentrations (38,000 ug\/L), with benzene, ethylbenzene and MTBE at 3,830, 1,130, and 1.3 ug\/L, respectively.  Subsequent sampling of well MW-10R has revealed the presence of LNAPL.  DTW for MW-10R is 12.50 feet.  Well MW-10R is situated adjacent to a residence, resulting in a vapor intrusion investigation conducted in 2016.      A review of groundwater data indicated a correlation of depth to water and groundwater flow may exist and that the groundwater flow direction appears to swing easterly during periods of high groundwater.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has been providing regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003337 since February 2019 subsequent to referral by a property transaction.  To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations printing nd solid waste and scrap metal operations with associated former underground storage tank.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil). To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include remedial and off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility.  Remedial soil excavation was completed in late 2021.  Redevelopment of the Site includes demolition of all existing structures and development of six floors of residential condos over the ground floor of commercial\/retail.  Parking will include a subterranean parking garage with car stackers.  Redevelopment will include soil excavation to approximately 9.5 feet below ground surface (bgs) in three areas to accommodate construction of the car stackers and excavation to approximately 6 feet bgs to accommodate construction of the building elevator.      The Site is located at 412 Madison Street in Oakland at the southeast intersection of 5th Street and Madison Street near the Interstate 880 corridor.  The Site is located in a former industrial area of Jack London Square which is currently zoned commercial. The property is bound to north by 5th street and Interstate 880; to the east by commercial properties and a operational gas station; to the south by multi-unit residential; and to the west by Madison Street and a new multi-unit residential structure which has not yet been completed. The property recently transfer ownership and is currently vacant. Historical operations at the Site included a solid waste and scrap metal recycler with a single building, warehouse structure, and two larger balers and scales. Recycling operations were broken down into four components; purchasing, sorting and metal compaction, finished goods, storing and shipping, and lubrication and waste oil storage. Other historical operations on the site included mixed residential and commercial from approximately 1889 through 1953 which included a printing facility operation from approximately 1911 until 1953.  From approximately 1957 to 2019 the facility has operated as a solid waste and scrap metal recycler known to have handled hazardous materials in the past.  As of early 2019 the property has remained vacant. Currently, proposed redevelopment will include six floors of residential condos over the ground floor of commercial\/retail.  Parking will include a subterranean parking garage with car stackers.  Redevelopment plans have been submitted as Appendix B of the Remedial Action Plan, dated May 3, 2019.  Proposed redevelopment will include soil excavation to approximately 9.5 feet below ground surface (bgs) in three areas to accommodate construction of the car stackers and excavation to approximately 6 feet bgs to accommodate construction of the building elevator.    Historical records search indicates a 500-gallon underground storage tank (UST) previously located at the property was removed without proper permits or regulatory oversight.  According to tank permit records dated in November 1992, the UST was installed in 1972 and was apparently last used in 1988.  Regulatory inspection reports from 1992 also indicated numerous violations related to unpermitted acceptance and storage of hazardous waste including waste oils and solder dross. An ACDEH inspection report from May 1993 indicated soil samples collected from within the former tank excavation area at 5 feet bgs reported total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPH-g) at 4.5 (milligrams per kilogram; mg\/kg), total lead at 1,200 mg\/kg, and low levels or non-detect concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX).  Soil samples were also collected at 9 feet bgs reported concentrations of toluene 0.013 mg\/kg and lead at 1.8 mg\/kg.     Subsequent investigation activities were conducted in December 1996 and included the advancement of one soil boring in the former UST excavation area to a depth of 8 feet bgs.  TPH-g, BTEX and MTBE were all below laboratory detection limits.  Groundwater was observed at 14 feet bgs.  Grab groundwater samples reported TPH as diesel (TPH-d) at 130 (microgram per liter; ug\/l) and lead at 160 ug\/l.  The detected concentrations are above the January 2019 San Francisco Bay Regional Quality Control Board's Tier 1 environmental screening levels (ESLs).     Recent subsurface investigations were conducted without regulatory oversight in November 2017 and February 2018.  Investigations conducted during November 2017 included the advancement of eight bores and the collection of shallow soil samples (ranging from between 1 and 3.5 feet bgs) and four grab groundwater samples from 11 to 19 feet bgs. Soils samples were analyzed for TPH, BTEX, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  Groundwater was analyzed from TPH, VOCs and metals. Soil samples indicated lead was detected up to 2,340 milligrams per kilogram; mg\/kg.  Groundwater results indicate TPH-d and cobalt above ESLs. Investigations conducted in February 2018 consisted of the advancement of ten soil bores (M9 through M18) at shallow depths ranging from 1 to 3.5 feet bgs.  Soil samples were only analyzed for cobalt and lead and reported lead concentrations up to 8,030 mg\/kg.  Soil samples results from both November 2017 and February 2018 indicate the majority of soil from the upper 3.5 feet bgs across the subject site is impacted with lead above ESLs.  Chlorinated VOC tetrachloroethene (PCE) was detected in soil and groundwater in boring M5 located in close proximity to the east-central property boundary.  Additionally grab groundwater samples collected from M5 also indicate TPH-d above ESLs.  TPH-d was also detected in grab groundwater samples from upgradient locations including boring M1 and M3.    In March 2019 Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) and the new property owner Essex Madison, LLC had a kick-off meeting to discuss the path forward and the proposed redevelopment.  At that time, former recycling operations were in the process of closure.  Prior to closure, a Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) inspection was conducted in May 2019. The Inspection Report noted PCB was detected in the composite sample of four 55 gallon drums of oil. The oil was from decades of accumulation from recycled materials that were processed by the baler. According to the facility representative, the PCBs were not from transformers, but likely from small ballasts and scrap materials inadvertently process by the facility. Oil drippings from the baler processing were captured and re-used to lubricate the baler's exterior. The re-used oil was reportedly not placed into the baler's internal reservoirs. The baler was located adjacent to the rectangular pit and extended from the pit toward Madison Street (see attached figures for Baler location). The baler has been relocated to Lakeside Recycling. The used oil drums were stored in the Warehouse area.    Subsequent to the kick-off meeting and CUPA inspection a Remedial Action Plan and Soil Management Plan, both dated May 3,2019 were submitted to ACDEH for review.  Currently ACDEH is conducting a review of these documents.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) staff conducted a initial site review of the associated documents prepared and submitted by Odic Environmental (Odic) on behalf of Calmeat 2 LLC including the Phase II Environmental Site Assessment (Phase II), dated March 13, 2018.  On January 14, 2019, Calmeat 2 LLC paid a deposit of $1,392.00 dollars and requested ACDEH to conduct a preliminary site review of the data from the Phase II report.  A Site Cleanup Program (SCP) Case No. RO0003348 was opened to conduct the initial review on Phase II.  Subsequent to ACDEH's initial review a a preliminary kick-off meeting was conducted on February 20, 2019, with Calmeat 2 LLC, their environmental consultant (Odic) and the associated ACDEH case worker to discuss the current status of the site.  Based on our review, a second follow-up phone conversation with Calmeat 2 LLC and ACDEH was conducted on March 13, 2019.  Based on results of sub-slab vapor constituents, ACDEH has determined that regulatory oversight and additional investigation and corrective activities should be conducted under the former Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Case No. RO0003135 rather than creating a new SCP case.  As a result, ACDEH administratively closed the SCP Case No RO0003348 and reopened the former LUST Case No. RO00003135 associated with the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has been providing regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003402 since December 2019 subsequent to referral by the City of Oakland Planning and Building Department.  To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations including a bakery and warehouse operations.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil, soil vapor, and groundwater).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include the hazardous material survey and abatement of the existing onsite building and hardscape; demolition of existing Site buildings and above ground infrastructure; remedial soil excavation and off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility; capping and consolidation of remaining soil; soil mixing with amendments for microbial remediation and biodegradation; and installation of vapor mitigation engineering controls to control potential vapor intrusion to indoor air of the proposed development and migration along new utility corridors.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes demolition of the remaining building and construction of a four-story mixed use commercial and residential complex with low-income housing and a parking lot. Commercial uses include a health clinic on the ground floor. Construction will be slab on grade, with one non-hydraulic elevator.       The Site is located in a mixed commercial and residential (primarily commercial) area of the Elmhurst Park neighborhood in Oakland adjacent to the southern bound of International Boulevard (formerly E. 14th Street) near the intersection between International Blvd and 94th Ave.  The property consists of eight adjacent parcels and is comprised on one city block between 94th and 95th totaling approximately 33,000-square feet (SF) including assessor parcel numbers (APNs) and associated addresses;  44-4967-1 (9401 International Blvd), 44-4967-2 (9409 International Blvd), 44-4967-3 (9415 International Blvd), 44-4967-4-2 (1361 95th Ave), 44-4967-4-3 (9423 International Blvd), 44-4967-5 (9431 International Blvd), 44-4967-7-1 (9437 International Blvd), and 44-4967-9 (95th Ave, No Address). The Site is currently a vacant lot currently used as parking.  A portion of the Site located at 9401 International Blvd is occupied by residential and retail\/commercial operations including a thrifty shop.    Based on information presented in the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA), dated December 12, 2018, prepared by Ninyo &amp; Moore for the responisible party, histroical operations conducted at 9401 and 9403 International Blvd included a lumber storage area in1905. By 1912, the site located at this address was developed with two \"stores\" on the northeastern end, and a \"Bake Ho\" [bakery] on the southwestern portion. The site was addressed as 9401 and 9403 International Boulevard, and 1378 94th Avenue at that time. The bakery included an oven along the southern side of the building, and a room on the southwest corner of the building. A 300-gallon \"distill tank\" was mapped along the southwestern side of the building. It is unclear if this tank was an aboveground or underground tank. The  300- gallon \"distill tank\" was not depicted on the 1925 Sanborn Map. By the early 1950s, site development at 9401 and 9403 included a \"Store\" and a \"Drugstore\" on the eastern end, and a bakery on the western end. A 100-gallon \"oil tank\" was mapped along the western interior wall within the bakery \"oven\" room. It is unclear if this tank was an aboveground or underground tank. By the 1952 Sanborn map, the 100-gallon \"oil tank\" was no longer mapped. By 1950, the Elmhurst lumber operation on the Site and surrounding property had been discontinued and the lumber shed had been removed from the Site.  By 1966, the warehouse on the southwestern portion of the Site is labeled as vacant and the 1974 aerial photograph indicates that the warehouse building was no longer evident on-Site.  The store fronts have been relatively unchanged. The ground-level area is used for various commercial and the second level of the build is used for residential.    A previous Phase I ESA, dated September 14, 2017, prepared by Iris Environmental dba RPS for addresses 9409, 9415, 9417, 9419, 9423, 9431, and 9437 International Boulevard, 1361 95th Avenue, and an additional parcel that does not have an address on 95th Avenue (identified as Assessor’s Parcel Number 044-4967-009).  Historical operations for all the properties are included in a table on Page 9 through Page 11 of the September 2017 Phase I ESA.  Historical operations at the above-mentioned addresses included various retail (lumber storage, dry cleaner, paint store, glass shop, Cleaning compound shop, as well as residential units.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In July 1988 six UST were removed and confirmation soil sampling detected free product concentrations of TPHms in soil. Groundwater monitoring wells were installed in 1992 to evaluate the dissolved phase plume. From 1999 to 2005 several on and offsite investigations were completed to evaluate the extent of contamination in soil and groundwater. The site was redeveloped between 2003 and 2005 with 62 residential condominiums and approximately 14,000 cubic yards of soil and 2,900,000 gallons of water was removed during redevelopment activities. In April 2005 an offsite investigation detected significantly elevated concentrations of TPHms beneath downgradient residences. Currently, the downgradient extent of dissolved phase contamination is undefined and offsite investigation has been proposed.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The subject site is one of seven sites with a co-mingled soil and groundwater contaminant plumes sites (Oakland National Engravers; RO0000079; Dunne Quality Paints; RO0000073; San Francisco French Bread Company; RO0000171; Celis Service Station; RO0000453; SNK Andante; RO0002530; Oak Walk; RO0002733, and Magnolia Terrace; RO0003004).  The groundwater contaminant plume extends a minimum distance of approximately 1,200 feet in length (see attached paleochannel figure).  The soil and groundwater plumes appear to have moved through a series of granular paleochannels (with significant interconnectivity) that is present beneath the sites.    The subject site appears to have been contributed contamination to all downgradient sites (San Francisco French Bread Company; RO0000171; Celis Service Station; RO0000453; SNK Andante; RO0002530; and Oak Walk; RO0002733).  The subject site, in addition to the adjacent Oakland National Engravers site (RO0000079) appears to have contaminated groundwater beneath an innocent residential landowner (four Victorian homes; Ennis Properties) with free-phase concentrations of mineral spirits, and the adjacent Magnolia Terrace (RO0003004) with lower contaminant loads.  Onsite remedial actions have occurred at the site; however, despite multiple requests a Remedial Action Report has not been submitted to document the scope of these actions.  Additionally despite multiple requests, the site has not been claimed in Geotracker, and reports have not been uploaded; both are state requirements.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Summary – This fact sheet has been prepared to inform community members and other interested parties of potential case closure for a fuel leak case at the Shell-branded service station at 105 5th Street in Oakland, California (see attached map on back).  Site investigation and cleanup activities have been completed and it does not appear that the fuel release presents a risk to human health for nearby residents or site workers.  Site investigation activities, which were conducted at various times between 1999 and 2012, have defined the extent of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil, soil vapor, and groundwater beneath the site.  Groundwater monitoring was conducted from July 1999 to July 2008 using seven groundwater monitoring wells at the site.  The groundwater monitoring data indicate that the concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater have decreased since 1999 and that water quality is expected to be restored to water quality objectives through natural attenuation processes.  During the most recent groundwater sampling event in July 2008, the maximum concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) detected in groundwater beneath the site was 980 micrograms per liter (parts per billion).  Between August 2009 and December 2011, soil vapor sampling was conducted at ten locations throughout and along the margins of the site.  Elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil vapor samples collected from three locations within the interior portion of the site but were not detected at concentrations of concern along the margins of the service station or near the station kiosk.  The residual contamination does not appear to pose a risk to nearby residents or site workers.    Background – The site is an active service station at the corner of 5th Street and Oak Street in Oakland, CA.  A fuel release was discovered during an upgrade of the dispensers and piping system in November 1996.  Soil and groundwater sampling activities have taken place at various times between 1999 and 2012.  Periodic dual-phase vacuum extraction was conducted from April 2000 to March 2001 to remove petroleum hydrocarbons in the vapor and groundwater phases.  Periodic groundwater extraction was conducted at the site from November 2001 to June 2006.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Four fuel (two diesel and two gasoline) underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed by American Consulting Remediation and Construction in January 1998 and 1,200 tons of petroleum impacted soil was disposed offsite. Peagravel was used to fill the excavation and new 20,000-gallon fuel USTs were installed soon thereafter. Soil samples collected during tank removal activities contained elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons. Soil and groundwater investigations began in 1998 following UST removal\/replacement activities. In July 1998, Brunsing Associates, Inc. installed six soil borings and three groundwater monitoring wells to assess soil and groundwater conditions. ACC Environmental Consultants, Inc. (ACC) conducted groundwater monitoring from September 2000 to June 2004. In August 2003, ACC installed eight direct-push borings to further characterize the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons and MTBE in onsite and offsite soil and groundwater at the site.  A soil and groundwater investigation work plan dated July 29, 2008, prepared by Pangea was approved in September 2008. The work plan included offsite soil vapor sampling and an additional offsite well for groundwater plume delineation. The work plan was never implemented, however. The last round of quarterly groundwater sampling occurred September 18, 2008, as reported in the October 30, 2008 groundwater monitoring report by Pangea. The site wells have not been sampled since 2008. There have been recent investigations at a nearby housing project located downgradient of the Site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently a mixed-use commercial and residential multi-story building. The ground floor is occupied by commercial space and a podium-style parking structure with below-grade stacked parking. A 10,000-gallon gasoline UST, one 6,000-gallon gasoline UST, and one 550-gallon waste-oil USTs were removed from a commercial gas station in May 1986 and the station was permanently closed. Soil samples collected beneath both gasoline USTs did not detect TPHg at or above the laboratory detection limit of 2 mg\/kg TPHg. TPH waste oil (TPH wo) was not detected at or above the laboratory detection limit of 10 mg\/kg in the soil sample collected from the waste oil UST.  None of the confirmation soil samples taken during the UST removal were analyzed for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX).     In 2006, grab groundwater samples collected from three soil borings detected 18,000 ug\/L TPHg and 690 ug\/L benzene, indicating that an unauthorized release of petroleum hydrocarbons had occurred and this Leaking Underground Fuel Tank (LUFT) case was opened to investigate the release.    Environmental investigations were conducted between 2001 and 2006, prior to and during site redevelopment into a mixed commercial and residential multi-story building. To accommodate the below-grade stacked parking associated with the podium-style parking structure on the ground floor, the northeastern portion of the property was excavated in a rectangular-shaped area measuring 150 feet in length by 20 feet width by 15 to 21 feet in depth. This excavation was oriented perpendicular to the two former gasoline USTs and possibly resulted in the partial removal of secondary source associated with the former gasoline USTs.    This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH determined that the site meets all the LTCP General Criteria and the Media Specific Criteria for Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Exposure, but not the Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater or the Media Specific Criteria for Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air.    Although the site does not meet the distance criteria to the nearest surface water body, ACDEH has determined that the extent of dissolved petroleum hydrocarbons for the site should be expected to extend an average distance or less of approximately 250 feet. This estimate is conservative because the USTs were removed in 1986 and additional secondary source was removed during excavation and prior to development in 2006.    Additionally, although the site does not meet the Media Specific Criteria for Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air, documentation indicates that a vapor barrier was installed below the building. However, since the plans were not provided for ACDEH’s review and approval or a record report of construction for the vapor barrier installation was not submitted, ACDEH cannot verify that the vapor barrier was installed to specifications. The ground floor is occupied by commercial space and a podium-style parking structure with below-grade stacked parking, ACDEH is reasonably confident that the site poses a low risk to human health and safety and the environment. The determination was based on receptors and environmental conditions identified at and in the vicinity of the site at the time of closure and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios. Therefore, case closure is granted for the current commercial land use as a mixed-use commercial and residential multi-story building.  If a change in land use to any residential, commercial other than as a mixed-use commercial and residential multi-story building, or conservative land use, or if any site redevelopment is planned, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2. Any below grade work require planning and implementation of appropriate healthand safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site was reportedly utilized by Shell as an automotive repair and fueling facility from 1959 to 1979. During this period, the Site reportedly housed three petroleum underground storage tanks (USTs) of approximately 10,000-gallon capacity that would have been located 14 to 16 feet below ground surface. The three USTs were removed in 1979 and a 2,000-gallon UST was installed at the Site in 1980. Visual evidence consisting of concrete and other debris beneath the former 2,000-gallon UST suggests that the 2,000-gallon UST was installed in the same location as the previous 10,000-gallon USTs.    The 2,000-gallon UST was removed on October 11, 1994 by KTW &amp; Associates. Soil samples were collected at 11 feet bgs, and laboratory analysis of the soil samples indicated concentrations of TPH-g ranging from 870 mg\/kg to 18,000 mg\/kg and benzene ranging from 2.9 to 100 mg\/kg (samples designated as TP-1-N and TP-2-S). Upon removal of the 2,000-gallon UST, strong odors were reported in the topsoil and no overspill protection was observed, indicating possible surface spills of petroleum hydrocarbons.    In May 1995, ACC Environmental Consultants advanced borings on the Site for collection of soil and grab groundwater. ACC observed non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) in borings B1, B5, B6 and B9. ACC sampled the NAPL and submitted the samples for fingerprint characterization and lead content analysis to Friedmann and Bruya. The analysis indicated the NAPL was characteristic of leaded gasoline with a reported organic lead content of four grams per gallon. Maximum reported concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in grab groundwater from the investigation were the following: 89,000 μg\/l of TPH-g; 21,000 micrograms per liter (μg\/l) of benzene; 11,000 μg\/l of toluene; 3,800 μg\/l of ethylbenzene and 16,000 μg\/l of xylenes.    A reconnaissance of the site by Enviros in 1995 indicated a state of poor housekeeping. Enviros reported the Site was used as automotive repair, with cars parked across the Site; presence of an open 15 foot by 15 foot excavation covered by a blue tarp; used batteries; a steel drum labeled as used oil filters; and, a white plastic drum with a blank hazardous waste label.    In 1996, the UST excavation, which had previously been left open, was over-excavated from 9 to 11 feet bgs. Verification sampling following the remedial excavation indicates that impacted soil was left in place at the base of the excavation, with TPH-g in verification sample TP-4-E having a reported concentration of 2,700 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) of TPH-g.    Additional secondary source removal efforts conducted at the Site consisted of installation of oxygen release compound (ORC) socks in wells V-1, V-2, and MW-5 in 2001, 2003, and 2005, and a five-day dual phase extraction (DPE) pilot test in 2006. No further remedial efforts have been conducted at the Site since 2006 to reduce the petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in soil, groundwater, and soil vapor.     ACDEH has requested preparation and submittal of a feasibility study to evaluate cleanup technologies for the Site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This case, which applies to parcels 7-589-1 and 7-589-24, has addresses for 1549 32nd Street and 2868 Hannah Street.  Currently, this case is Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) case RO0003160 but was formerly RO0002508.  A new case number was assigned when a new development was proposed for the site. The site is currently a vacant lot.  The City of Oakland has approved building permit plans for the proposed \"Hannah Street Lofts\" redevelopment project contingent upon clearance of environmental conditions at the site from ACDEH.  The project consists of a three story building consisting of 36 residential units (apartments), 11 work\/live units and ground floor parking.    From the 1940's to 1983, the site heat-treated metal products, and operated as a steel foundry from 1983 to 2002. A putty and paint factory also operated at the site until 1985.  In 1988 a soil investigation was conducted and included advancement of 4 exploratory soil borings (unknown depths and locations). Concentrations of ethanol, methanol, 1,1-dichloroethene (1,1,-DCE), and metals were detected in the samples.    In March 2002, samples collected from four soil borings were reported to have elevated concentrations of total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons (TRPH) and minor concentrations of BTEX. In April 2002, during advancement of seven soil borings, free floating oil was observed, and a waste oil percolation well discovered. Remedial soil removal activities were conducted in April and May 2002 in the vicinity of the percolation well. Grab groundwater sample analytical results reported elevated concentrations of BTEX, 1,2 - DCE and naphthalene.    In May 2003, 11 soil borings were advanced to depths of approximately 16 to 20 feet bgs and three temporary piezometers installed. Groundwater flow direction was estimated to be west to northwest. Soil sample analytical results reported elevated concentrations of total extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (TEPH) and VOCs. TPH and dissolved metals were reported in grab groundwater samples.    Between September 2003 to January 2004, remedial soil excavation activities were conducted to remove soil containing TEPH as hydraulic oil above 500 mg\/kg. Approximatley 3,202 cubic yards of soil was excavated and disposed of off-site.     In April 2005, site investigation activities were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the remedial soil excavation activities and included advancement of 15 soil borings primarily around the perimeter of the site and soil gas samples.    In September 2008, nine soil borings (EB1 through EB9) were advanced at both on and off-site locations to further characterize the vertical and lateral extent of COCs in soil and groundwater. Soil samples were analyzed for TEPH as diesel-range and motor oil-range petroleum hydrocarbons and halogenated VOCs. The results of the investigation were provided in a Subsurface Investigation Report dated October 16, 2008.    In February 2015, Madison Park Financial Corporation of Oakland met with ACDEH to discuss redevelopment of the site and submitted a Phase 1 ESA dated February 2, 2015 site conceptual Model dated February 16, 2015. In March 2015 soil and grab groundwater samples were collected by Madison Park without approval from ACDEH. A Phase II Environmental Site Assessment dated August 10, 2015 was subsequently submitted .       In a Soil Remedial Action Work Plan dated September 3, 2015, the responsible party proposed excavation of soil in the southern portion of the site and on-site aeration of the contaminated soil.  Tetrachloroethene (PCE) has been detected in soil in the southern portion of the site.  During a public comment period on the proposed soil cleanup that was open until October 16, 2015, several comments objecting to the proposed action were received.      The responsible party submitted a Soil Remedial Action Work Plan Amendment dated January 8, 2016 (see Site Documents) that revises the proposed action to include soil excavation and off-site disposal of the contaminated soil.  On site aeration of soil is no longer part of the proposed action.  A Fact Sheet describing the revised soil removal action was distributed to stakeholders for a 30-day public participation period which ended May 3, 2016. No objections to the revised remedial approach were received. On December 8, 2016 ACDEH approved a work plan to collect additional data to refine the proposed remedial action at the site. The work was conducted in December 2016 and a meeting was held with ACDEH and the RP on February 9, 2017 to discuss the results of the investigation. Additional data is proposed to be collected in July 2017 to refine the proposed remedial action. The results of the December 2016 and July 2017 field investigations and a Human Health Risk Assessment will be incorporated into a revised RAP.    On April 9, 2018, a followup stakeholders meeting was held between ACDEH and Madison Park Financial to discuss delays in the project schedule and develop a path forward for development. During this meeting ACDEH and the RP discussed the actions that would be implemented as part of remediation and mitigation as well as data gaps that remain pertaining to off-site exposure. A revised schedule was agreed upon during the meeting and ACDEH requested submittal of several documents, including a (1) a Corrective Action Plan; (2) Submittal of an updated project schedule; (3) Public Participation Fact Sheet; and (4) a Corrective Action Implementation Plan.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is located on a small land parcel within a predominantly residential neighborhood in central Oakland, along Seminary Avenue. An automotive repair business (Amor's Auto Electric Repair) recently operated on the property. Environmental-related activities began at the site in 1989, following the removal of three gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs) and one waste oil UST.  All four USTs were reportedly installed in the 1930s and each UST had a capacity of 550 gallons.  A hydraulic lift, formerly located inside a building on the property, was removed in 2001. The primary chemicals of concern include petroleum-related compounds and chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants (PCE, TCE, vinyl chloride, and cis 1,2 DCE) which have been detected in the subsurface from historic land use at the site.  Petroleum-related and chlorinated contaminants have been detected in soil, groundwater, and soil vapor and data collected during previous site assessment investigations suggest the source of contamination at the site may emanate from three separate sources: the former gasoline USTs, the waste oil tank, and the hydraulic lift formerly located in the service bays. From November 2014 to November 2015 groundwater and soil vapor were removed and treated using a cleanup technology known as dual-phase extraction (DPE), which removed approximately 343 pounds of petroleum hydrocarbons and 27,120 gallons of contaminated groundwater.  DPE was conducted at an ideal time, when groundwater levels were low due to drought conditions. Groundwater levels increased appreciably in late 2015, and therefore, DPE was discontinued. Further cleanup is proposed for the Site consisting of excavation of soil to a depth of 20 feet to remove approximately 500 to 600 cubic yards of petroleum-impacted soil. Following excavation, the soil will be disposed offsite at a landfill. Cleanup activities are expected to take about five weeks and are expected to be completed by June 2022.",

An investigation occurred in 2006 in which three borings (T1 through T-3) were advanced at the site to obtain soil samples after discovery of a fill pipe in the sidewalk.  The maximum concentrations were 15,000mg\/kg TPHd from near the UST and 96 TPHd from beneath the piping.      On April 19, 2007, four borings (B-1 through B-4) were advanced in the vicinity of the UST.  Groundwater was encountered in two borings at approximately 21 feet bgs and maximum hydrocarbon concentrations were indicative of free product at 2,400,000 µg\/L TEHd.  No BTEX, oxygenates, or lead scavengers were detected in groundwater or soil samples.  The maximum hydrocarbon concentration in soil was detected at 18 ft bgs in B-1 at 100 mg\/kg.    The 1,000-gallon heating oil UST was removed on August 27, 2007.  The UST was removed and soil was overexcavated to 15 feet bgs.  Soil samples collected from the bottom of the excavation contained maximum concentrations of 85 ppm TEHd, 8.8 ppm TVHg, 110 ppm TVHmo and 4.2 ppm lead.     On November 17, 2008 monitoring well MW-1 was installed in the planter area next to the sidewalk that previously contained the heating oil UST and close to boring B-1.  At this time, 75 pounds of oxygen releasing compound (ORC) was injected adjacent and in the middle of the tank pit at three injection locations.      Groundwater monitoring was conducted for an additional 5 quarters.  Dissolved oxygen levels remain elevated in the subsurface.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently in commercial usage as an oil change business.  In 1994, four 2,000 gallon gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs) and a 350 gallon waste oil UST were removed from the site. In 1999, 200 yds3 were excavated from the northeast part of site during redevelopment by the property owner while still an active fuel leak case. MW-4 was inadvertently destroyed during construction and MW-1 was properly destroyed in preparation for construction. In January 2000, a soil boring HA-1 was placed in the footprint of new oil change building to confirm residual TPH. During the fall 2000, MW-2 and MW-3, damaged during construction in 1999, were rehabilitated and MW-4 was replaced by MW-5. Remaining wells MW-2, MW3, MW5 were monitoring and sampled on a quarterly basis since January 2004.  Site investigation have been ongoing since 1996 and have included installation of a groundwater monitoring well network and collection of soil, groundwater and soil gas samples. In November 1998 a dual-phase extraction (DPE) event was conducted; six temporary monitoring points were installed MP-1 – MP-6; groundwater and soil vapor were extracted from MW-3 and MW-4; 21 lbs. vapor phase TPH and 75 gallons TPH-contaminated groundwater were recovered; MP-1 – MP-6 were abandoned. In September 2010, MW-2, MW3, MW5 were re-developed.  In November 2010: five soil vapor monitoring wells, VW1 – VW5 were installed ranging from 5 feet to 6 feet bgs.  The five soil probes were sampled in 2010 and 2012 and both sampling events detected benzene and ethylbenzene in VW4 and VW5 in exceedance of the LTCP’s Soil Gas Criteria for No Bioattenuation Zone for Commercial Use.  Benzene concentrations up to 30,000 micrograms per cubic meter (ug\/m3) and ethylbenzene concentrations of 95,000 ug\/m3 were detected in VW4 located outside and adjacent to the bathroom. In 2014, the results of a dual-phase extraction (DPE) feasibility study concluded that DPE did not produce a significant reduction in soil vapor concentration.  An FS\/CAP was submitted on October 25, 2012, followed by the First CAP Addendum on September 24, 2013, and the Second CAP Addendum on December 12, 2013.  A Well Installation and Feasibility Study was submitted on September 10, 2014.  ACDEH requested submittal of a Work Plan Addendum to install and seasonally sample sub-slab probes in the southern part of the building to assess vapor intrusion to indoor air.  The sub-slab work plan submitted in November 2018 was approved and two sub-slab probes will be installed and the potential risk of vapor intrusion will be assessed to both on- and off-site receptors due to a bioattenuation zone that is less than 5 feet in thickness, the presence of elevated Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) in soil vapor in VW-4 and VW-5, and in groundwater at MW-5 and MW-8, and the potential of TPH contamination adjacent to the former waste oil UST. A Soil, Soil Vapor, and Groundwater Investigation Report and updated SCM is in preparation.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Prior to 1989 the site operated as a gasoline service station. Previous investigations indicate that five underground storage tanks (USTs) previously existed on site including two 6,000-gallon gasoline USTs, one 550-gallon waste oil, and one 1,000-gallon solvent UST. One of the USTs was said to have been removed prior to 1988; however, no documentation exists regarding this UST and its removal. Available records do not indicate who pulled the tank, the contents of the tank, or the exact date of the removal, but it is believed that this tank was located close to the location of monitoring well MW 1. The other four USTs were removed in 1989. During the 1989 UST excavation, soil samples were collected from beneath each tank, and the tanks were observed to have no obvious pitting or corrosion. 10 cubic yards of soil that were deemed contaminated were stockpiled onsite, and sent for analysis. High concentration of fuel contamination was detected in the northeastern excavation, and in the waste oil\/ solvent UST excavation.    In September and October 1989, a preliminary investigation was conducted to determine whether fuel detected in soil during UST excavation activities impacted groundwater. Two locations (north western, and waste\/oil solvent excavation area) were re-excavated and 25 cubic yards of additional contaminated soil was removed. The northwestern excavation was backfilled with a combination of clean fill and re-used “uncontaminated soil” from the initial excavation of the two gasoline USTs while the waste oil\/solvent excavation was backfilled with clean fill.   Construction of the existing commercial 2-story building began in early 1991.    Starting from October 1989, monitoring wells (onsite and offsite) and soil borings were installed to define the lateral extent of the contaminant plume.  A periodic subsurface monitoring program was implemented to monitor contaminants from October 1989 to December 2015. Trend analysis from these subsurface investigation indicates that dissolved-phase hydrocarbon plume in the groundwater appears to be generally stable.    Two soil vapor probes and two sub-slab soil vapor probes were installed in November 2006 and December 2015 respectively to assess vapor intrusion risk to indoor air within the on-site building. Based on the sample results obtained from these vapor probes, no concentrations were detected above regulatory screening levels, and it was determined that no potential risk for vapor intrusion to the site building exists.         Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern  The chemicals of concern at the site are residual TPHg, TPH as diesel, and BTEX in groundwater and soil from the former gasoline USTs located in the northwest portion of the site and the former USTs located in the sidewalk along 8th Street. Since soil vapor results showed no concentrations were detected above regulatory screening levels, direct contact and ingestion appear to be the two potential exposure to these chemicals of concern.    Remediation Activities  Remediation was conducted by over excavating hydrocarbon contaminated soil below the former USTs. No additional corrective actions were performed at the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site was operated as a gasoline station and was formerly an open case (RO0000891) from 1995 to January 29, 1997 when it was closed by ACEH for commercial use only.  The site has had the previous addresses: 554 27th Street and 550 27th Street.  The site was opened as RO2948 when proposed land use changed to residential.  The proposed building is to be commercial use on the first floor along 27th Street and subgrade parking along Merrimac Street with a car ramp on the south side of the building for access to the parking.  Residential units will be on the second floor.     A Preliminary Site Assessment was performed in February 2007.  One soil boring was advanced near former well MW-3 which had previously contained the maximum benzene concentration in groundwater at the site.  TPHg was detected at 20 ppm in soil at 10.3 feet, but no hydrocarbons were detected in the 11.5 foot sample.  Up to 2,300 ppb TPHd, 11,000 ppb TPHmo were detected in groundwater.  No TPHg or BTEX was detected in the groundwater sample.      Eight soil borings were advanced between February 14 and 18, 2008.  Maximum concentrations were 220 ppb TPHg and 196 ppb TPHd and no benzene was detected.  Four soil vapor samples were also collected during this investigation.  Benzene was detected in only one sample at a concentration of 12 µg\/m3 and is below the residential ESL for benzene.  Gasoline was detected in two samples at a maximum concentration of 1,900 µg\/m3.  All other TO-15 analytes were either below the detection limits or at least 2 orders of magnitude below the respective ESL for each constituent.  Site Management Requirements:  Case closure for this site is granted for the currently proposed construction configuration (as of 4\/1\/08) of a multistory residential building with the first floor comprised of commercial space and a subgrade parking garage.    If the currently proposed construction configuration changes or any construction\/excavation activities encounter contamination that is indicative of higher residual concentrations than reported in this closure summary's after columns of the Maximum Documented Contaminant Concentrations table, then ACEH must be immediately notified.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site was redeveloped in 2007 and is currently the site of a Whole Foods Market at the intersections of Bay Place, Harrison Street, and Vernon Street in Oakland, California.  The site is approximately 1,000 feet north of Lake Merritt.  Surrounding land use is mixed commercial and residential.      Two underground storage tanks (USTs) were present at the Site as part of the automobile service facility.  The two USTs consisted of a 3,000-gallon waste oil tank, which was removed in December 1988, and a 10,000-gallon gasoline UST, which was removed in January 1994.  During the excavation and removal of the 10,000-gallon gasoline UST in January 1994, a hole was observed in the product piping that lead from the UST to the fuel dispenser.  Free-phase product was observed on the groundwater surface in the gasoline UST excavation.  In June 1994, approximately 100 cubic yards of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) affected soil adjacent to the former gasoline UST and along the western portion of the former product piping route, was excavated and removed.      Several soil and groundwater investigations have been conducted at the Site since 1992.  The investigations found petroleum contamination in soil and groundwater within the areas of the former USTs and former hydraulic lifts and tanks.  Two areas with elevated concentrations of lead were also identified beneath the building.  A total of eleven hydraulic lifts along with nine floor drains and associated piping were excavated and removed between June 2005 and November 2005.  Approximately 1,010 tons of soil adjacent to the hydraulic lifts was excavated and transported to Waste Management’s Altamont Landfill in Livermore, CA for disposal.  A total of approximately 285 tons of lead-affected soil was transported to Clean Harbors Class I landfill in Button Willow, CA for disposal.  During the period from September 16 to December 16, 2005, a total of approximately 5,000 tons of TPH-affected soil was excavated from the area of the former USTs and transported to Allied Waste’s Forward Landfill located in Manteca, CA for disposal.    Quarterly and later semiannual groundwater monitoring was conducted at the site between March 1993 and April 2010.  The groundwater monitoring data indicate that a plume containing dissolved petroleum hydrocarbons is present in the area of the former USTs and extends beneath Bay Place.  The highest concentration of MTBE detected during the most recent sampling event in April 2010 was 1,400 parts per billion.  No water supply wells or other potential receptors are expected to be affected by the plume.  Site investigation and cleanup activities have been completed and it does not appear that the fuel release presents a risk to human health for nearby residents or site workers.  Therefore, Alameda County Environmental Health is considering potential closure of the fuel leak case.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Current Land-use at time of Case Closure  The subject property (APN 003-00590-13-02) is located 1700 Castro Street, in the western portion of the City of Oakland near Interstate 980.  At the time of this case closure, the site is a current active Chevron Gasoline Station with a convenient store building located near the eastern property boundary and accordingly this case is closed to the current commercial land-use risk scenario, consisting of an active gasoline service station with a convenient store structure developed at the site.  Due to residual contamination, the site was closed with site management requirements that include notifying Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) of a proposed change in land use to any residential or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment or building alteration is proposed that affect or disturb the existing subsurface conditions at the site.    Adjacent Property(ies) Land-use at Time of Case Closure  At the time of this case closure, groundwater contamination extended off-site underneath Castro Street.  However, should off-site redevelopment occur, ACDEH recommends evaluating the redevelopment site(s) for chemicals of concern identified on this site.    Historic Land-use \/ Site Investigation  The site is an active Chevron Service Station site, where an unauthorized release was discovered during a UST system upgrade in February 1997 to install under dispenser pans.  In May 1997 wells MW-1 to MW-3 were installed.  In March 1999 wells MW-4 to MW-6 were installed.  In March 2001 well MW-7 was installed.  In March 2004 bores B1 to B4 were installed to re-characterize soil for the installation of a new UST complex for a station remodel.  In April 2004 four 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs were removed from the site, and two new USTs were installed in a new area south of the old UST complex.  No other investigation or cleanup was performed in relation to the dispenser islands or USTs.    The downgradient extent of the MTBE plume was defined using the State Water Board’s (SWB) Technical Justification for Groundwater Media-Specific Criteria, dated April 24, 2012 by determining the area of the maximum extent of a potential MTBE groundwater plume as documented by the SWB paper, and requesting that the area be canvased to determine the potential for an unknown private water supply well to be present and extract groundwater.  After multiple attempts to identify one potential well owner, the address was identified, and the owner verbally indicated a well was not present at the address.  The well location is at an approximate distance of 1,070 feet to the northwest.  In general, groundwater flows to the west.  The SWB paper found that the maximum plume length for methyl tert butyl either (MTBE) is 1,046 feet.  Because the potential well is at a distance greater than the SWB’s maximum MTBE plume length and is located cross-gradient to the predominant direction of groundwater flow, the potential well does not appear to be at risk as a sensitive receptor from MTBE contamination released at the site.    Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern  The USTs that were used to store diesel and gasoline are believed to be the source of the contamination discovered at the site.  The main chemicals of concern (COCs) associated with the USTs and detected at the site were TPH-d, TPH-g, BTEX, and SVOCs including naphthalene.  Inhalation and ingestion appear to have been the most likely potential routes of exposure to these COCs.    Remediation Activities  Source removal of the UST was performed at the site.  No additional corrective actions was performed at the site.      Case Closure &amp; Future Site Management Requirements   This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP). This site does not meet the Direct Contact criterion due to residual soil concentrations of benzene between 0 to 5 and 5 to 10 feet bgs that exceed the LTCP criteria; however, these soil samples are over 19 years old, were located in a silty sand matrix, and are expected to have decreased by natural processes in the intervening years.  ACDEH has evaluated case information and, as a result of controlling exposure through the use of institutional and engineering controls, has determined that the concentrations of petroleum constituents in soil will not have a significant risk of adversely affecting human health.  Specifically, except for limited areas around the perimeter of the site, the site is entirely paved and exposure to site soils is prevented, except in controlled conditions.  Additionally, exposure to contaminated soil and soil vapors is limited by low permeability pavements. As a commercial fueling facility, maintenance or construction workers employed at the facility are required by California regulations to be trained in health and safety concerns associated with volatile motor fuels, and thus are expected to be prepared for potential exposures in their standard work routines.  Potential exposures to the general public are expected to be transitory and could occur only while temporarily present for the purpose of fueling their vehicles or obtaining related automotive services.     This site also does not meet the Direct Contact criterion due to the lack of analysis in soil for naphthalene at sampling locations CT-4 and CB-6 that document the highest residual soil concentrations for TPH as gasoline and TPH as diesel at the site.  The locations are not currently available for sampling as they are near or beneath existing product pipeline runs.  The LUFT manual indicates that naphthalene is present at an average of 0.25% and a maximum of 0.36% in fresh gasoline product and an average of 0.26% and a maximum of 0.8% in fresh diesel.  This indicates that naphthalene may be present at a concentration up to 5.12 mg\/kg at these samples.  This is below the Table 1 criteria for naphthalene for a commercial facility.    Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs including station building modification, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.

The residential units have address of 134 E 16th Street, Units #1 through #18, and the commercial units are addressed as 1601, 1603, 1605 and 1607 2nd Avenue.  A structure has occupied the property since at least 1962.  Prior to the current use of the building as apartments, the property may have operated as a hotel.  The hotel operated from at least 1992 through approximately 1997.     One underground storage tank (UST) containing heating oil was discovered beneath the sidewalk along the East 16th Street frontage of the property.  The tank was 10 feet in length by 5 feet in diameter and constructed of single wall bare steel.  A fuel line between the UST and the apartment building was removed and capped at the building entrance.  The age of the tank is unknown and the owner had no prior knowledge of the tank nor is there any indication of previous site investigation activities.  The tank was found to be in poor condition with visible holes.  Soil discoloration and hydrocarbon odors were observed in the tank overburden soil and\/or in the soil beneath the tank.  Approximately 22 tons of soil excavated from the tank pit was profiled and disposed after elevated concentration of TPH was detected.  The pit was backfilled with clean import material.      This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  ACDEH determined that the site met all the LTCP General Criteria and two of the Media Specific Criteria.  ACDEH has made the determination that the site poses a low risk to human health and safety and the environment.  The determination was based on receptors and environmental conditions identified at and in the vicinity of the site at the time of closure and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios.",

Surrounding land use is commercial.    In April 1986, four exploratory borings (S-A through S-D) were advanced within the area of the tank complex to total depths of 20.5 feet below grade (fbg).  Soil samples contained up to 5,700 ppm TPH.    In December 1986, a semi-quantitative soil vapor survey was conducted using a portable gas chromatograph.  The soil vapor survey reported “very high” vapor concentrations near the storage tank fills and pump island closest to MacArthur Boulevard.  “Moderately high” concentrations were reported beneath much of the remaining area.  No additional soil vapor sampling and laboratory analysis was conducted to confirm or quantify these results.    In March 1987, three soil vapor extraction (SVE) wells (VR-1, VR-2, and VR-3) were installed.  The SVE treatment system operated between April and November 1987.  In August 1987, two soil borings (B-1 and B-2) were advanced to characterize petroleum hydrocarbons remaining in the soil.  Soil samples contained up to 1,870 ppm TPHg.    In November 1987, two 8,000-gallon gasoline USTs and one 10,000-gallon gasoline UST were removed.  Soil samples collected from the bottom of the UST excavation contained up to 480 ppm TPHg, 4.3 ppm benzene, 2.2 ppm toluene, and 55 ppm xylenes.  New USTs were installed in the same excavation.    In August 1989, three soil borings (SB-1, SB-2, and SB-3) were advanced in the area adjacent to the pump islands.  Soil samples contained up to 490 ppm TPHg.  Benzene was not detected at concentrations above the reporting limit in these soil samples.    On October 10, 1989, three borings (GS-1, GS-2, and GS-3) were advanced to obtain grab groundwater samples from the area adjacent to the pump islands.  Grab groundwater samples taken from GS-2 contained up to 8,800 ppb TPHg, 380 ppb benzene, 27 ppb toluene, 1,200 ppb ethylbenzene, and 62 ppb xylenes.  These constituents were not detected at concentrations above the reporting limit in the grab groundwater sample from GS-1.      Monitoring well MW-4 was installed in January 1990.  In May 1990, six borings (Probe 1 through Probe 6) were advanced in the sidewalk along West MacArthur Boulevard to obtain shallow groundwater samples.  Grab groundwater samples contained up to 31,000 ppb TPHg, 430 ppb benzene, 600 ppb toluene, 240 ppb ethylbenzene, and 1,400 ppb xylenes.  TPHg and BTEX were not detected at concentrations above the reporting limit in grab groundwater samples collected from borings Probe 1 or Probe 3.    In October 2002, a sensitive receptor survey (SRS) and conduit study identified a storm drain located just west of the site, along West MacArthur Boulevard, as a potential preferential pathway for contaminant migration.  In October 2003, an additional SRS was completed to identify basements within 200 feet, surface water, and sensitive habitats within 500 feet, hospitals, residential care and childcare facilities within 1,000 feet, and water wells within one-half mile.  No basements were observed within 200 feet and no surface water or sensitive habitats were observed within 500 feet.      In March 2004, two soil borings (SB-1 and SB-2) were drilled adjacent to the storm drain located west of the site, and soil and groundwater samples were collected.  Soil samples contained up to 43 ppm TPHg and 0.0099 ppm MTBE.  BTEX were not detected at concentrations above the reporting limit in the soil samples.  Grab groundwater samples contained up to 10,000 ppb TPHg, 430 ppb benzene, 75 ppb toluene, 98 ppb ethylbenzene, 44 ppb xylenes, and 320 ppb MTBE.    In April 2005, soil samples were collected from beneath the site’s dispensers and piping following an upgrade of the site’s fueling system.  Soil samples contained up to 2,700 ppm TPHg, 4.2 ppm benzene, 6.6 ppm toluene, 39 ppm ethylbenzene, 85 ppm xylenes, and 0.30 ppm MTBE.  A UST Unauthorized Release\/Contamination Site Report was filed on April 26, 2005 in conjunction with over-excavation of impacted soils.  Following over-excavation, eight bottom and side-wall samples were collected.  Soils samples contained up to 830 ppm TPHg, 1.4 ppm toluene, 4.1 ppm ethylbenzene, 1.5 ppm xylenes, and 0.017 ppm MTBE.    In April 2006, four soil borings (SB-4, SB-6, SB-7, and SB-8) were advanced on site.  Soil boring SB-8 was converted into on-site groundwater monitoring well MW-5.  Soil samples from the borings contained up to 1,510 ppm TPHg, 2.90 ppm benzene, 9.47 ppm toluene, 9.46 ppm ethylbenzene, 70.6 ppm xylenes, 0.00970 ppm MTBE, and 0.0142 ppm di-isopropyl ether (DIPE).  Grab groundwater samples contained up to 34,000 ppb TPHg, 404 ppb benzene, 22.5 ppb toluene, 110 ppb ethylbenzene, 56.8 ppb xylenes, 29.2 ppb MTBE, 40.2 ppb  tertiary-butyl alcohol (TBA), and 26.6 DIPE.    In February 2008, three off-site soil borings (SB-9, SB-10, and SB-11) were advanced southwest and west of well MW-5 to further delineate groundwater impacts down gradient.  One on-site soil boring (SB-12) was drilled adjacent to well MW-5 for groundwater data comparison.  MTBE was detected in one soil sample at a concentration of 0.0053 ppm in SB-12 at 15.5 fbg.  TPHg, BTEX, TBA, DIPE, ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE), and tertiary-amyl methyl ether (TAME) were not detected at concentrations above the reporting limit in the soil samples.  Off-site grab groundwater samples contained up to 1,700 ppb TPHg, 14 ppb toluene, and 120 ppb MTBE.  Benzene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, TBA, DIPE, ETBE, and TAME were not detected in the off-site grab groundwater samples.  The on-site grab groundwater sample contained 4,900 ppb TPHg, 120 ppb benzene, 11 ppb toluene, 170 ppb ethylbenzene, 42.2 ppb xylenes, 33 ppb MTBE, 100 ppb TBA, and 11 ppb DIPE.    Groundwater monitoring has been conducted at the site since July 1988.  Coordinated monitoring and sampling has been conducted with the adjacent former gas station, currently Oakland Auto works at the property of 240 West MacArthur Boulevard, since the fourth quarter of 2003.  Significant seasonal variations in groundwater elevations have been observed.  Constituent concentrations have generally been highest in monitoring well and MW-5, which is located immediately down gradient of the former UST and dispenser islands.  Overall decreases in constituent concentrations have generally been observed in groundwater monitoring results from the site indicating that natural attenuation of dissolved petroleum hydrocarbons is apparently taking place.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The subject site was used as a service station until 1972 when the site was demolished and the tanks removed.  The station building, two dispenser islands, one waste oil UST, and two gasoline USTs were removed.  An earlier generation of USTs had previously been removed.  Since 1975 it has been used as a parking lot.  A soil vapor survey was conducted in 1988 to determine if the site had been impacted, three wells were installed in October 1988, four wells were installed in 1989, four wells were installed offsite in June 1990, two offsite wells were installed in October 1991, and another two wells were installed offsite in late 1992, for a total of 16 wells.  Limited soil excavation was conducted in January 1992.  An SVE system operated onsite in 1993, but showed minimal effectiveness.  In June 2004 the first generation UST pit was investigated and impacts were discovered.  In April 2007 four bores were installed to investigate the extent of contamination associated with the first generation USTs.  In June 2007 a vapor survey was conducted and elevated concentrations were detected in all vapor points.  In early 2008 105 bucket auger bores were installed to remove impacted soil associated with the first generation USTs.  A report on the installation of a post-remediation groundwater monitoring well and the installation of several soil bores to infill a data gap in the downgradient extent of the groundwater plume was generated.  Well MW-17 was installed in October 2010.  Additional excavation of soil impacted by the second generation USTs and the waste oil UST was conducted between January and June 2011 as part of the redevelopment project for the subject site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is an active service station operating four dispenser islands and two automotive service bays equipped with hydraulic lifts.  Due to residual contamination, the site is closed with Site Management Requirements that limit future land use to the current commercial land use as an active fueling station.      In April and May, 1998 two 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs, one 550-gallon waste-oil UST, product piping and four dispensers were removed from the site.  Elevated petroleum hydrocarbons and oxygenates were detected.  Subsequent investigations have been performed to date to define the lateral and vertical extent of contamination.  in April 2000, four on-site groundwater monitoring wells, MW-1 through MW-4,  were installed, followed by two additional wells, MW-5 and MW-6,  in October, 2002.       In February and March 2006, two on-site and five off-site  CPTs were advanced to 50 feet, identifying a shallow (15- 23 feet) and a deep water bearing (35-45 feet) zone. Shallow and deep ground water samples were collected from three of the CPTs -one on-site and two off-site. The on -site CPT, CPT-1, was reported to contain TPHg, benzene, and MTBE at concentrations of 4,700, 29, and 160 ug\/L in the 17- to 20 foot bgs interval and at 1,800, 52, and 25 ug\/L in the 41- to 46-foot interval.  Groundwater samples collected from off-site CPTs -3 and -5 were non-detect for all analytes in the shallow and deeper zones.  One on-site and two off-site groundwater monitoring wells were installed in July, 2007.  On-site well MW-7, situated down gradient from CPT-1 and screened at 40-55-foot interval, has not reported detectable concentrations of TPHg, BEX, and MTBE, with one detect of toluene at a concentration of 1.4 ug\/L for the 17 quarters of monitoring\/sampling. Off-site down gradient wells MW-8 &amp; MW-9, screened in the shallow interval, have not reported detectable concentrations of TPHg, BEX, and MTBE.   Wells MW-8 &amp; MW-9 have each reported one detectable concentration of toluene,  at 1.4 ug\/L and 1.3 ug\/L, respectively, in the 17 quarters of monitoring\/sampling of these wells.      In a meeting held on April 8, 2014, ACEH acknowledged the case may be a candidate for closure in the near future under the State Water Resources Control Board’s (SWRCBs) Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (LTCP) provided concerns regarding down gradient receptors of the contaminant plume and vapor intrusion to indoor air are addressed. The  VI to indoor data gap was addressed in the June 2014 plume length and foundation evaluations.",

Current commercial tenants include an acupuncture clinic, professional and administrative offices, short term residential business, and dry cleaner.  Based on interviews with the previous dry cleaner owner, the unit was purchased in 1980 from an pre-existing dry cleaning business which used tetrachloroethene (PCE) based dry cleaning solvents in their machines.  Various PCE-based dry cleaning units have operated in the commercial space since 1962 until the current petroleum hydrocarbon based unit was replaced in 2011.          A former service station operated in the northwest property adjacent to the subject Site; located at 1425 Leimert Blvd.  Based on limited information presented in the Phase I regarding this property, it appears service station operations were conducted between approximately 1933 until 1970.  A search on the State Water Board’s GeoTracker website indicated there are no current or former cases associated with the service station property. Currently, the former service station property is presently occupied by a commercial building with subterranean parking; Oakmore Professional Building.     Results of recognized environmental conditions (RECs) identified in the Phase I were further investigated as part of an additional Phase II subsurface investigation conducted at the Site during December 2017.  Four borings were advanced for the collection of soil and sub-slab vapor samples.  Data from these borings indicated total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline-range (TPH-g); benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTEX); tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene (PCE and TCE), were detected in sub-slab vapor located in the boiler room (southwest) and adjacent to the former location of the dry cleaning unit (west).  PCE was detected in sub-slab vapor at SS-4 in the vicinity of the former dry cleaning machine at a concentration exceeding the ESLs for potential vapor intrusion under commercial land use.  PCE was also detected in other sub-slab samples within the dry cleaning suite, however, at concentrations below the ESLs for sub-slab vapor intrusion under commercial land use.  One soil sample collected at 1 foot below the building slab, due to shallow bedrock, reported concentrations below laboratory detection limits for all potential constituents of concern (PCOCs).  Groundwater samples were not collected during investigation activities.     A building survey conducted by EIS in September 2018 is summarized in the Site History Activity Report The survey was conducted to evaluate, select and assess potential sub-slab vapor sampling locations, and evaluate vapor intrusion to indoor air and potential preferential pathways.  Results of the survey indicated the building is constructed with a concrete slab on grade foundation with the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system consisting of forced air units located on the roof.  A total of eight restrooms. sinks, and bathrooms; and three floor drains in the rear of the three ground floor units are plumbed to a sanitary sewer outlet in Suite 1433.  An abandoned sub-slab water line was observed running along the northwestern wall of Suite 1431.  The current above-ground water line for the building enters Suite 1431 near the eastern corner and is plumbed to the remaining units within the walls.  Flooring within all ground floor units was observed in good condition with only minimal cracking visible in Suite 1431.     A subsequent subsurface vapor investigation work plan was submitted to evaluate potential vapor intrusion to indoor air and preferential pathways at the Site.  The scope of work includes the advancement of 14 semi-permanent sub-slab vapor pins (SV-1 through SV-14) across Suites 1431, 1433, and 1435.  Based on ACDEH directive letter dated December 4, ACDEH requested the advancement of additional vapor pins along the southeast wall of Suite 1431, temporal sub-slab sample collection, indoor air sample collection in Suite 1431 and its associated lavatory (slab penetrations), and the advancement of two soil gas wells in the area of the drum storage area (alley).",

The Site occupies the entire city block bound by 53rd street to the north, Dover street to the east, 52nd street to the south, and Martin Luther King Jr Way to the west except for a single approximately 0.1 acre parcel (14-1206-4) located in the southeastern corner of the Site which is developed as a single family residence. Current improvements to the Site reportedly consist of a six story outpatient clinic with ground level parking (OPC2) located at the southwestern corner of the site, a five-story outpatient clinic (OPC1) located adjacent and to the east of OPC1, a five floor parking structure located adjacent and to the north of OPC1 and OPC2, and five single family residential structures which have been converted for commercial use by the Children’s Hospital and Research Center at Oakland (CHRCO). Ground cover at the Site consists of predominantly hardscaped areas with minimal landscaping. The facilities at the Site are operated as a children’s hospital and research center. Land use in the vicinity of the site consists of single family residences and additional facilities associated with the children’s hospital.     The Site is currently regulated by ACDEH under the authority of a Voluntary Remedial Action Agreement (VRAA) that was executed on June 15, 2017 and was entered into by ACDEH and UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland. The Site is being regulated due to the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons in the motor oil range (TPHmo), diesel range (TPHd), and gasoline range (TPHg) in soil samples and the presence of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and associated breakdown products, specifically trichloroethene (TCE), which have been reported as present in groundwater at the Site.",

To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to various commercial configurations such as dry-cleaning\/laundry, blacksmith, wagon shop, and numerous retail such as physicians office, photo shop, jewelers.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include remedial soil excavation and off-Site disposal of impacted soil at a permitted disposal facility.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes a 39-story residential tower and a 4-story office retail building with one level of subsurface parking.  Redevelopment will include the demolishment of the existing commercial  properties and excavation of soil to about 26-32 feet below ground surface for construction of a mat slab foundation.            The 0.7-acre subject site consists of two land parcels associated with Assessor's Parcel Numbers (APNs) 008-0638-006-05 and 008-0638-007-10. The current site owner is 19th &amp; BWAY  Associates, LLC however a property transaction with Behring Capital is pending.  Site redevelopment activities have been permitted by the City of Oakland and will include excavation of depths of up to 32 feet below ground surface (bgs) and construction of subsurface parking and an office\/retail tower; Historic land use at the site dates back as early as 1889 and includes but is not limited to dry cleaning, blacksmith and wagon shop, office, typewriter and carbon ribbon company,  physician offices, automotive, photoshop, theater, and parking lots. Historic land use at nearby properties include a brewery, planning mill, laundry, plating and polishing facility, paints, vulcanizing, plumbing supplies, and motorcycle repair.  Undocumented fill material (including debris consisting of concrete, metal, glass, and wood) has been document to depths of approximately 12 feet bgs.  Results from limited site investigations conducted in 2016 document chemicals of concern in soil and groundwater at concentrations above environmental risk based screening levels.",

An Underground Storage Tank Closure Report (USTR) dated February 26, 2019 documents the activities surrounding the in-place abandonment of two the USTs, the third UST was determined to have been previously abandoned in-place having been backfilled with concrete.   On August 22, 2018, the two USTs were evacuated to the extent practicable prior to backfill with a controlled density fill (CDF) sand slurry.  A pothole was advanced adjacent to each UST for the recovery of two soil samples, both collected at a depth of approximately 10 feet below the ground surface (bgs).  One pothole was excavated deeper to a depth of approximately 11 feet bgs for the collection of an excavation pit grab-groundwater (GGW) sample.  Maximum soil concentrations of TPHg and TPHd of 3,000 mg\/kg and 470 mg\/kg, respectively.  The GGW was reported to contain 1,300 ug\/L TPHg and 10,000 ug\/L TPHd.

According to GGTR, after removal of the tank, inspection of the exposed tank pit bottom did not reveal soil discoloration (staining) or noticeable petroleum odors in the back fill or native sand soil beneath the tank.  However, during UST removal, the CUPA inspector observed strong odors and soil discoloration and received odor complaints from neighbors. GGTR personnel observed the soil surrounding the UST to resemble clay. GGTR did not encounter water in the excavation during the tank removal or in the boreholes during soil sampling activities.    On June 16, 2022, GGTR submitted three (3) confirmation soil samples in six (6) containers to McCampbell Analytical, Inc. (McCampbell) of Pittsburg, California (State ELAP Certification no.  1644) under formal Chain-of-Custody (COC) protocol. McCampbell reported detectable concentrations of TPH-Diesel in the discrete confirmation soil samples collected beneath the east and west ends of the UST excavation at 6.3 and 11 milligrams per Kilogram (mg\/Kg), respectively, and non-detectable concentrations of Volatile Organics below laboratory reporting limits (RL). The stockpile composite sample had detectable concentrations at 360 milligrams per Kilogram (mg\/Kg) of TPH-Diesel and Volatile Organics below laboratory RLs and Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs). The LUFT 5 Metals results show a detectable concentration of Nickel at 100 milligrams per Kilogram (mg\/Kg) in confirmation sample collected beneath the west end of the UST excavation while the east end and the stockpile composite soil samples are below laboratory RLs and Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs).    Due to the elevated concentration of Nickel measured in the discrete sample collected from the west end of the excavation, GGTR, on June 30, 2022, revisited the site to perform overexcavation and confirmation re-sampling activities. GGTR over-excavated the UST cavity to approximately twelve (12) fbg, removing the hydrocarbon-impacted soil from the west end of the UST cavity and transferring it directly to dump trucks provided by Poli Trucking for offsite transport and disposal. GGTR reported that soil was removed until no noticeable petroleum staining or odor was present in the excavated soil.  McCampbell reported a non-detectable concentration below respective laboratory RLs for Volatile Organics and below ESLs of TPH-Diesel. The LUFT 5 Metals results show a small decrease of Nickel concentration at 95 mg\/Kg (from 100 mg\/Kg), the rest of the LUFT 5 metals are below ESLs.  Due to data gaps identified at the site, ACDEH has opened a LUFT case.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) has been providing regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Cleanup Site Program Case No. RO0003508 since August 17, 2021. ACDEH’s review of the Case File included information contained in the State Water Resources Control Board’s GeoTracker website for two closed environmental cases (RO0000891 and RO0002948) to determine whether there are environmental concerns at the parcel(s) that warrant further investigation. Although a Phase I Report was not submitted, ACDEH noted that historical land use included a service station that utilized underground storage tanks (USTs). Additional historical uses may have impacted shallow soil at the Site from demolition related ebris including lead-based paint, asbestos, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorinated solvents.  To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to a gasoline service station that included the use of four underground storage tanks (USTs) for the storage of gasoline and waste oil. Results of these subsurface investigations has identified no chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil, soil vapor, and groundwater).  Thus ACDEH decided that a new clean up Case does not need to be opened for the Site, but the GeoTracker Case File will remain as a repository for the Site investigation data.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently occupied by Vic’s Auto, an automotive repair facility equipped with one 13,000-gallon underground storage tank (UST).  Surrounding land use is mixed commercial and residential.  Soils in the vicinity of the site are mostly fine to medium sand, with varying silt and clay content.    On June 17, 1993, four 1,000-gallon gasoline USTs and one 250-gallon waste oil UST were removed from the site.     No groundwater was encountered during excavation activities.  The tank conditions were slightly rusted, with two visible holes noted in the waste oil tank.  Soil samples collected from the gasoline UST pit and waste oil UST pit contained up to 24 parts per million (ppm) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) and 2,100 ppm Total Oil and Grease (TOG), respectively.  The waste oil tank pit was over-excavated and re-sampled.  The over-excavation soil sample contained 3.9 ppm TPHg.    On August 23, 1994, the two remaining 6,000-gallon gasoline tanks were removed from the site.  The UST located in the northern corner of the site was replaced with a 13,000-gallon gasoline UST.  Fourteen soil samples were collected from the tank pits and soil stockpiles.  The soil samples collected from beneath the southern-most tank contained the greatest petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations of 160 ppm TPHg and 0.82 ppm benzene.  The two tank pits were subsequently over-excavated to approximately 19 feet below ground surface (bgs).  Heavily contaminated groundwater and soils were encountered.  Confirmation soil samples collected after over-excavation contained up to 3,900 ppm TPHg and 6.1 ppm benzene.    On July 14, 1995, two soil borings were advanced and completed as groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 and MW-2).  Soil samples were collected from each boring at approximately five-foot intervals.  Well MW-1 was not sampled for groundwater because free product was observed in the well at a thickness of 2.22 feet.  Groundwater depth at the site was measured to be 17.21 feet bgs.  The soil samples contained up to 390 ppm TPHg and 0.3 ppm benzene.  The groundwater sample from MW-2 contained 68,000 parts per billion (ppb) TPHg and 480 ppb benzene.    On August 8, 1996, three soil borings (SB-1 through SB-3) were advanced to depths ranging between 24 and 25 feet bgs.  Soil samples were collected from each boring at 24 feet bgs, with an additional sample collected from boring SB-1 at 18 feet bgs.  Grab groundwater samples were also collected from each boring.  The soil sample collected from boring SB-1 at 18 feet bgs contained the greatest contamination of 9,100 ppm TPHg, 57 ppm benzene, and 47 ppm MTBE.  The grab groundwater samples contained concentrations of up to 140,000 ppb TPHg, 19,000 ppb benzene, and 27,000 ppb MTBE.      Manual bailing and pumping of Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (LNAPL) from well MW-1 occurred intermittently from 1997 to 1998.    On May 25, 2001, two soil borings were advanced and converted to monitoring wells MW-3 and MW-4.  Soil samples were collected from each boring at 15 and 20 feet bgs.  The completed wells were sampled during the next monitoring event on June 29, 2001.  Soil samples collected from the borings did not contain petroleum hydrocarbons or fuel oxygenates at concentrations above reporting limits.  Groundwater from wells MW-3 and MW-4 contained up to 550 ppb TPHg.  Groundwater from well MW-2 collected during the same monitoring event contained 69,000 ppb TPHg, 7,200 ppb benzene, and 4,400 ppb MTBE.       Due to the continued presence of free product, a LNAPL recovery system was installed in well MW-1 in July 2001. Well MW-1 is located within the backfill of the southern-most gasoline UST.  The LNAPL recovery system operated between 2001 and 2003.    On April 2 and 3, 2003, fourteen soil borings (SB-4 through SB-17) were advanced both on-site and off-site.  Soil samples were collected from the borings at depths ranging between 11 and 18 feet bgs.  Grab groundwater samples were collected fromeach boring and soil vapor samples were collected from five of the borings.  The soil samples collected from boring SB-7 at 18 feet bgs and SB-11 at 16 feet bgs contained the highest TPHg concentrations of 4,900 ppm and 2,700 ppm, respectively.  Borings SB-7 and SB-11 are located southwest of the former UST locations.  Similarly, groundwater samples collected southwest of the former UST locations contained the highest   TPHg concentrations.  TPHg and benzene were detected in grab groundwater samples at concentrations up to 310,000 ppb and 45,000 ppb, respectively.  Soil vapor samples did not contain petroleum hydrocarbons at concentrations above reporting limits.    On January 11, 19, and 20, 2005, six extraction\/monitoring wells (MW-5 through MW-7 and MW-10 through MW-12) were installed both on-site and off-site, with the intent of utilizing a High Vacuum Dual-Phase Extraction (HVDPE) system in the near future.  At least one soil sample was selected for analysis from each well.  Groundwater samples were collected from newly completed and previously constructed wells (MW-1 through MW-4) on February 3, 2005.  The soil samples contained up to 3,200 ppm TPHg, 35 ppm benzene, and 8.5 ppm MTBE.  Results of the groundwater samples were similar to previous investigations with the high petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations detected south of the former UST locations.    From July 11 to July 27, 2005, a 15-day HVDPE event was conducted in five of the extraction\/monitoring wells.  During the event, an estimated 10,600 pounds of hydrocarbons were removed in the vapor phase.  Following this event, preparations were made to implement a fixed HVDPE system at the site.  Startup of the HVDPE system began on June 26, 2007.      On July 13, 2006, eight soil borings were advanced throughout the site and off-site in the downgradient direction.  Four of the borings were converted to permanent, nested soil gas probes (GP-1 through GP-4).  Soil samples and soil gas samples were collected from the gas probes at depths of five and ten feet bgs.  The soil samples contained up to 1.6 ppm TPHg, with no concentrations of MTBE above reporting limits.  The soil gas samples contained up to 705 micrograms per cubic meter (µg\/m3) TPHg and 6.1 µg\/m3 benzene.      On March 18, 2008, wells MW-8, MW-9, and MW-13 were installed to delineate the petroleum hydrocarbon plume in groundwater.  Soil samples were collected from the new wells at depths of 15 and 20 feet bgs and contained up to 1.5 ppm TPHG, 0.37 ppm benzene, and 0.089 ppm MTBE.    Between August 21 and 22, 2008, soil gas probes GP-3 and GP-4 were decommissioned due to property development.  Horizontal HVDPE conveyance piping laterals were installed on wells MW-10 through MW-12 to continue remediation.    On July 28, 2009, three monitoring wells (MW-14 through MW-16) were installed off-site to delineate the downgradient extent of the petroleum hydrocarbon plume in groundwater.  Soil samples were collected from each of the monitoring well borings at depths ranging between 16 and 25 feet bgs.  Groundwater samples were collected from the new wells during the next monitoring event on August 21, 2009.  Results of the monitoring event incorporating the newly established wells indicated that the petroleum hydrocarbon plume extended laterally from the former UST location to approximately 7th Street.      On March 17, 2010, four soil borings (SB-16 through SB-19) were advanced as part of a source zone delineation study.  Soil samples were collected from the borings at approximately two or three foot intervals at depths ranging between 15 and 25 feet bgs.  The highest concentrations of TPHg and benzene in soil were detected in soil samples collected below the water table at a depth of 20 feet bgs.  Soil samples from borings SB-19, SB-16, and SB-17 contained TPHg at concentrations up to 7,500 ppm, 4,300 ppm, and 2,100 ppm, respectively.  Benzene concentrations in soil were highest in borings SB-19 and SB-17 at concentrations of 100 ppm and 87 ppm, respectively (both samples collected at a depth of 20 feet bgs).  Groundwater was first encountered in the borings at approximately 19.5 feet bgs with the exception of borings SB-16 and SB-19, where groundwater was encountered at approximately 25 and 21 feet bgs, respectively.  One grab groundwater sample collected from boring SB-18 contained 230 ppb TPHg and 3.2 ppb benzene.    On June 30 and July 1, 2010, four air sparge wells (AS-1 through AS-4) were installed within the source zone to a total depth of 30 feet bgs.  A pilot test for HVDPE with air sparging was conducted between August and October 2010.  Results indicated that air sparging in conjunction with the HVDPE system increased the effectiveness of petroleum hydrocarbon mass removal by increasing the off-gas vapor concentrations.      High Vacuum Dual Phase Extraction (HVDPE) remediation was conducted at the site from June 2007 to June 2011 in both on-site and off-site wells.  The remediation system removed an estimated total of 5,663 gallons of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg).    A soil vapor sampling event was conducted on October 16, 2012.  Five new soil gas probes (GP-5 through GP-9) were installed and sampled along with the remaining two existing soil gas probes (GP-1 and GP-2) on October 31, 2012.  TPHg was detected in soil vapor from vapor probe GP-1 at a concentration of 2,700 µg\/m3. TPHg was not detected at concentrations above reporting limits in the remaining eight soil vapor samples.   Benzene was not detected in soil vapor depth at concentrations above reporting limits in any of the nine soil vapor samples collected.    Groundwater monitoring began at the site on June 29, 2001 and was conducted quarterly until the most recent groundwater monitoring event on May 5, 2012.  The depth to groundwater in site monitoring wells has ranged between 12.61 to 20.44 feet bgs.  Soil vapor was also monitored on a quarterly schedule from August 2006 to August 2008.    Results of soil, groundwater, and soil vapor investigations indicate that a plume of petroleum hydrocarbons extended from the former southern-most UST location a distance of approximately 200 feet southwest (downgradient) of the site.  HVDPE and air sparging remediation has reduced the concentrations of TPHg in groundwater from the highest detection of 310,000 ppb in 2003 to a maximum concentration of 250 ppb during the most recent groundwater monitoring event in May 2012.  Benzene has also been reduced from a maximum of 52,000 ppb in February 2005 to a maximum concentration of 250 ppb during the most recent groundwater monitoring event in May 2012.    Groundwater monitoring data indicate that the plume of petroleum hydrocarbons is stable or shrinking in extent.  Based on evidence from recent investigations, the residual soil, groundwater, and soil vapor contamination from the former USTs does not appear to pose a threat to public or environmental health.  Therefore, no further action is required for the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is a commercial 0.83-acre vacant lot bordered to the west by Hegenberger Street, to the south by Hegenberger Loop, to the north by a Marriot Hotel, and to the east by the former Airport Cleaners. The western portion of the site operated as a gasoline station from 1956 to 1984 and had two 8,000-gallon and two 10,000-gallon steel underground storage tanks (USTs) and two fuel dispenser islands. The central portion of the site had two buildings with hydraulic hoists for vehicle repair and maintenance, a waste oil tank, and an oil water separator. The Precision Trucking School operated after the service station and buildings were demolished in 1985. Petroleum hydrocarbons impacted soil and groundwater were first detected in 1996 during removal of the waste oil tank and oil water separator. The records for removal of gasoline USTs are not available. Soil, groundwater, and soil vapor investigations have taken place at the site from 1996 to 2017. The investigations have defined the extent of contamination.There are no drinking water wells nearby, and shallow groundwater is not currently used as a source of drinking water. East Bay Municipal Utilities District supplies drinking water to the area.The USTs, fuel dispensers, and product piping were removed from the site prior to the 1996 initial investigation and approximately 650 cubic yards of soil was excavated in 2009. Groundwater monitoring from 1998 to 2009 show cleanup actions have significantly reduced contaminants at the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This UST release case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants.  Case closure is granted for the current commercial land use.    In addition, the release included lead, chlorinated solvents, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  Although the chemicals released at the site are predominately not chlorinated solvents, the case has also been evaluated consistent with criteria described in the Regional Water Board’s Assessment Tool for Closure of Low-Threat Chlorinated Solvents, as they are relevant and appropriate for evaluating closure.    The site does not meet scenarios 1 through 4; however, a determination been made that under current and reasonably expected future scenarios, the contaminant plume poses a low threat to human health and safety and to the environment and water quality objectives will be achieved within a reasonable time frame (Scenario 5).      The site does not meet any of the Vapor Specific Criteria due to the lack of analysis for naphthalene in soil gas.  Confirmation soil sampling conducted following over-excavation of the former fuel tank pit reported maximum naphthalene concentrations of 1.7 mg\/kg at 10 feet and non-detect &lt;0.010 mg\/kg at the former waste oil tank location.  Based on these findings, ACDEH has made a determination that the low- to no- residual concentrations of naphthalene do not present a significant vapor intrusion to indoor air risk.     This site does not meet this LTCP criterion due to the lack of analysis in soil for poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the 5- to 10-foot zone for remaining site soil.  Based on the low levels of residual contaminant concentrations for other analytes in the vicinity of the waste oil UST (WOT), the two rounds of over excavation of the WOT location appear to have removed the bulk of the residual contamination. Thus ACDEH concludes that the potential for residual PAH soil contamination in the 5- to 10-foot zone to be present at concentrations below the LTCP media-specific numeric values listed above.",

Prior to removal of the tanks in August 1990, the tanks were located beneath the sidewalk adjacent to Davis Street on the south side of the property.  During the most recent site investigation activities, the results of which are presented in a report entitled, “Subsurface Investigation Report (SG1-SG18, B12, B15-B19, B21-B32, C1-C5, MW3 and MW4),” dated August 19, 2009, petroleum hydrocarbons as Stoddard solvent, PCE, and other VOCs were detected in soil, soil vapor, and groundwater beneath the site and extending off-site.    Soil vapor, crawl space, and ambient air sampling was conducted at both on-site and off-site buildings in 2010.  Further crawl space and ambient air sampling has been requested by ACEH.  Results from the additional crawl space and ambient air sampling are to be submitted no later than May 10, 2016.    A soil vapor extraction (SVE) system was installed at the site and began operation in January 2014.  However, the SVE system was shut down and has not operated since February 28, 2014.   ACEH has requested that the SVE system resume operation no later than February 23, 2016.",

A more complete historic case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at https:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Site consists of a 39-acre property with the principal structure, building M110 -a 4-bay 310,00 sq-ft aircraft hanger- with surrounding paved areas of asphalt or concrete.  Added to this 39-acre site is the Economy Parking area.  Two USTs, a 3,000-gallon tank (MF-25) and a 1,000-gallon tank (MF-26) and associated piping, were removed from near the Building M-110. The tank site for MF-25 and MF-26 is described as located in the economy parking lot for the airport, at 1100 Airport Drive.   The tanks have been reported to be used for the storage of waste oil and for solvents.  Excavation sampling revealed the presence of up to 19,000 mg\/kg total oil and grease (TOG), 11,000 mg\/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), 1,000 mg\/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd).   Approximately 700 cu  yds soil stockpiled on site from the tank excavation.  Post over-excavation sampling revealed residual TPHd at 7 mg\/kg TPHd, 0.3 mg\/kg TPHg &lt;50 mg\/kg TOG and benzene to 0.02 mg\/kg.  Solvents, which had been identified in the excavated soil, were non-detect in the over-excavated pit.  GW was not encountered.      January 8, 1999 two 8,500-gallon USTs (tanks MF-37 and MF-38) containing Aer-O-Foam, a fire suppresion material consisting of animal protein and ethylene glycol, were closed in place.  As  ethylene glycol not detected, these tanks were considered NFA.      On January 15, 1999 two USTs- one 10,000-gallon diesel (MF-35) and one 10,000-gallon gasoline (MF-36) and associated piping, were removed from near the Building M-110.  Elevated concentrations of TPHd, TPHg, TPHj, benzene and MTBE detected in site soil and groundwater.  TPHd was reported at up to 16,000 mg\/kg, TPHg to 530, mg\/kg, and benzene to 1.9 mg\/kg.  The tank pit was over excavated and approximately 12,000 gallons of water pumped from the excavation.  GW reported having up to 16,000 ug\/L TPHg, 7,300 ug\/L TPHd 1,100 ug\/L benzene, and 130 ug\/L MTBE.   Approximateltely 700 cu yds for  total of ?843 tons remsoil removed.  well MW-1 installed in 1992 with two additional wells in 1995.  Groundwater is within 2.5 feet of the ground surface.  Free product was reported  in MW-2.  Groundwater monitoring resumed in 1998 with the installation of an additional five wells.  Concentrations of up to 4,000 ug\/L TPHg, 2,600 ug\/L TPHd and 3,400 TPHj wre reported.  Additionally several VOCs, including benzene at 150 ug\/L, 1,1-DCE to 180 ug\/L, 1,2-DCA , and 6.0 ug\/L VC were reported.  This site (MF35 &amp; MF36) was considered NFA status on 4\/23\/2001.    One groundwater monitoring well was installed in May, 1992.  TPHg, TPHd, asnd TPHj were reported at 70, 5,200, and 800 ug\/L, respectively.  Two wells were installed in May 1992.  Well MW-1-2 was installed withinn 10 feet of UST pit for MF-23 &amp; 24, MW-1-3 positioned within 10 feet of the former MF-25 &amp; 26 UST location.Two wells, MW-2 and MW-3, were installed in April 1995 in the vicinity of the former MF-25\/26 tank pit. TPHg, TPHj and TPHo were reported at 6,300, 11,000, and 1,600 mg\/kg in soil.  GW analysis indicated TPHg,  TPHj, TPHd,and TPHo at 7,200, 38,000, 1,400 and 31,000 ug\/L, respectively. NO VOCs other than BTEX were reported above lab RLs.  Free product was subsequently reported for wells MW-2 and MW-3.  A total of 30 wells were eventually installed across the greater site with 8 wells targting the Ecomomy Parking Area.  ORC was applied to wells circa 1999.  In addition to VOCs deteced at the site, elevated levels of metals, including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, molydbenum, and nickel have been found at the site.    A fill evaluation was performed in 2015 to evaluate the fill material as a potential source of metals detected at the site.  The fill evaluation study was inconclusive.  Additionally, a 2015 habitat study was conducted to evaluate if the drainage ditches along the northwestern portion of the property reflected an fresh water or estuarine environment. The eastern of the two ditches more resembled a brackish water (estuarine) environment and  the western of the two ditches was more characteristic of the transitional zone between fresh and brackish water.  The habitat study was conducted to determine if fresh or estuarine  ESLs should be used for the Tier 1 evaluation.    A data review was performed to determine if a correlation could be made between nickel concentrations in soil and groundwater.  The data review concluded that there does not appear to be a correlation between the elevated nickel concentrations in soil versus groundwater.",

The site was a former service station between 1938 and 1968.  The site is the current location of a multi-story building built in 1979.  After closure of the historic service station at the subject site, surficial soil was excavated and the site was redeveloped at a depth of 4 to 6 feet below the surrounding grade surface.  Four soil bores were installed in August and September 1999.  Grab groundwater was collected and indicated a release had occurred at the site.  Wells MW-1 and MW-2 were installed in December 2000.  An additional soil bore was installed in October 2013 in the reported UST complex to determine if the secondary source had been removed.  Two sub-slab vapor points were also installed to determine if the risk of vapor intrusion was present at the site, due to the earlier removal of 4 to 6 feet of soil.  The October 2013 investigation did not find contaminate levels of concern under the Low Threat Closure Policy.  The site is immediately adjacent (upgradient) to another case, and the potential for some commingling of the plumes may be present; however, concentrations in groundwater for the subject site are an order of magnitude lower than the adjacent downgradient site and are stable and decreasing.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The subject site is located at the northwest corner of San Pablo Avenue and 53rd Street on the Oakland-Emeryville border and was an operating Shell service station from 1958 until the mid-1970s.  Since the service station ceased operation, the site has been used only for auto repair; however, the fuel and waste oil USTs remained until 2007.     On September 14, 2007, AEI oversaw the removal of four USTs, (Two 7,500-gallon gasoline USTs, one 10,000-gallon diesel UST and one 550-gallon waste-oil UST).  Maximum petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations detected in the initial soil samples, collected from about 11 feet below ground surface (bgs), were as follows:  230 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) of total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg); and 73 mg\/kg of total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd).  Up to 1,500 mg\/kg of TPHg was detected in a soil sample collected at 2 feet bgs beneath the former dispenser area near the south central portion of the site.  No petroleum hydrocarbons or volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected in the confirmation soil sample collected from beneath the waste oil tank at 8 feet bgs.  Groundwater was not encountered during the excavation.    In January 2008, in an effort to remove hydrocarbon-impacted soil, the gasoline and diesel tank pit were enlarged and the dispenser area deepened.  AEI collected confirmation samples after overexcavation with the City of Oakland as oversight.  Impacted soil was removed to less than 100 mg\/kg in all areas, except for an area containing 160 mg\/kg of (total volatile hydrocarbons as gasoline (TVHg) on the south side of the property near the 53rd Street sidewalk.  Due to the close proximity of the sidewalk and other space constraints, the excavation could not be enlarged further.  The depth of the final excavation was approximately 12 feet bgs with no groundwater encountered.  In January 2008, the fuel tank and waste oil UST excavations were backfilled with clean imported material consisting of compacted class II fill with a drain rock cover.  Approximately 320 tons of contaminated soil was removed from the site as non-hazardous waste and hauled to the Keller Canyon landfill.     On March 5, 2010, Stellar Environmental supervised the advancement of four borings in and around the former UST area to obtain groundwater samples.  Maximum concentrations of 13 mg\/kg TVHg, 90 mg\/kg total extractable hydrocarbons as diesel (TEHd) and 0.021 mg\/kg benzene were detected in soil samples.  Maximum concentrations of 2,300 micrograms per liter (µg\/L) TVHg and 760 µg\/L TEHd were detected in groundwater samples collected from boring B3, located near the southwest corner of the site and downgradient of the former USTs.  Benzene was detected in only one groundwater sample at a concentration of 11 µg\/L in the boring advanced in the former UST tank pit.  Water was initially encountered between 17 and 20 feet bgs and equilibrated at approximately 8 feet bgs in the borings.    In May 2010, Stellar Environmental installed three monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-3), advanced two off-site borings (B-5 and B-6) along 53rd Street and performed a preferential pathway evaluation.  TEHd was the only constituent detected in soil at a maximum concentration of 6.6 mg\/kg in the soil borings.  72 µg\/L TEHd was detected in downgradientmost boring B-6.  No TVHg, TEHg, benzene or methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) were detected in groundwater samples collected from the wells.  Groundwater was encountered at about 17 feet bgs during drilling and equilibrated (reflecting the overlying clay confining pressure) at about 11 to 12 feet bgs in site monitoring wells.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently used for storage of metal shipping containers and vehicles.  Site development consists of two buildings.  The balance of the site is paved.  The site was previously occupied by a commercial fueling &amp; service station dispensing gasoline and diesel.  Subsequent site usage included vehicle repair facility(s).       Five steel USTs were moved from the site on December 8, 1999.  USTs reported to be in poor condition with several visible holes.  Evidence of significant soil contamination evident and free product and sheen noted on GW surface in excavation pits. Contaminated soil excavated for tank removals place back in excavation due to impending rain.  The UST pits were over-excavated in January 2000.  Approximately 124.77 tons of impacted soil was disposed of to Forward Landfill, Manteca and approximately 11,400 gallons of groundwater and rainwater that infiltrated the excavation pit was pumped out and disposed.  Following groundwater pumping, additional over-ex was conducted.  An additional 67.87 tons of impacted soil was disposed of off-site.  Additional groundwater pumping of approximately 9,700 gallons was also conducted.  On February 23, 2004, eleven borings were installed at the site with six converted to on-site groundwater monitoring wells.  Elevated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in soil and groundwater samples.  Three additional wells were installed in 2009, two of which were off-site.  Three of the four groundwater monitoring wells demonstrating the most elevated dissolved phase petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations have not been located since the April 17, 2009 monitoring event.      Feasibility Study recommended soil excavation as the most cost effective remedial method and also proposed soil gas sampling.  A Corrective Action Plan dated 10\/27\/2009, amended 4\/22\/2010, was approved by ACDEH on May 20, 2010 and went through public notification.  The CAP was not implemented and is not considered appropriate at this time due too the implementation of the SWRCBs Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy.  Groundwater monitoring resumed in 2017 after an eight year hiatus.  Direct evidence of LNAPL was not observed.    In December  2019, a  work plan was approved to  evaluate current site conditions, install new and replace former wells to address the LTCP Groundwater media specific criteria, collected additional soil samples for secondary source and direct contact evaluation and collect soil vapor samples at site structures for vapor intrusion evaluation.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "PCE at levels exceeding DNAPL threshold was inadvertantly discovered by the installation of well UO1-8.  The PCE contamination appears to be hydrogeologically controlled by the nearby 30-foot thick cement deep soil mixing wall described below.  The Port indicates that the source of the PCE is not from the former dry cleaning facility located in the former FISCO area.  Remedial investigations defined the lateral and vertical extent of the PCE in the UO1-8 area. The 7Feb10 CAP evaluated excavation, chemical oxidation, thermal treatment, groundwater extraction, and natural attenuation and selceted chemical oxidation.  The Port's bench-scale lab study (Study) did not determine how high the soil oxidant demand is in the UO1-8 area and is in the process of re-evaluating their Study.    In year 2000, the Port installed as part of their Vision 2000 program:  - Engineered concrete cap with an effective thickness of 6 feet over and beyond the TOFC area   - Cement deep soil mixing (CDSM) wall with a width of 30 feet along the edge of the Oakland Inner Harbor as a geotechnical stabilization structure.    - Slurry wall north of the CDSM wall  The concrete cap effectively isolates the diesel and other subsurface contaminants from potential human exposure. The CDSM wall has a  very low permeability that effectively isolates the PCE area around well UO1-8 from the Oakland Inner Harbor.  Along with the slurry wall, the CDSM also effectively isolates the diesel area from the Oakland Inner Harbor.  Given the thorough isolation, diesel plume shrinkage and stability, and low hydraulic gradient, the Water Board is on the verge of granting TOFC site closure pending the resolution of deed restriction and SMP questions.  The Water Board is presently reviewing the UO1-8 remedial action plan.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "In 1993 a proposed redevelopment project consisting of an open air multi-story parking structure at 1750 Webster Street prompted a Phase II investigation that identified contamination at the site.  Subsequently, a case was opened and subsurface investigations were conducted at the site including installation of three groundwater monitoring wells (A-1, A-2 and A-3).  Based on data collected during soil and groundwater investigations and a 1998 Risk-Based Corrective Action ACDEH and the Regional Water Board determined that contamination detected on the site appeared to be related to an up-gradient source and did not pose a risk to human health under the proposed redevelopment scenario or under the existing land use as an at-grade parking lot. In a letter dated February 9, 2000, ACDEH required recordation of a deed restriction for the site to ensure that the site was re-evaluated if the proposed development changed to include enclosed structures and directed that the three monitoring wells not be destroyed so the responsible party for the groundwater contaminant plume beneath the property could use the wells for future monitoring. The proposed open air parking structure failed to materialize and the site remained as an at-grade parking lot until 2017 when a new residential project was proposed. In 2017, Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0002672 was administratively closed and the three groundwater monitoring wells transferred to a new Site Cleanup Program Case No. RO0003229 for the Lennar Multifamily Communities redevelopment project.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Current Land-use at time of Case Closure  The subject property (APN 34-2300-13-5) is located 4575 Tidewater Avenue, in the western portion of the City of Oakland adjacent to San Francisco bay.  The 6.7 acre site, where the four underground storage tanks (USTs) were removed is situated between Tidewater Avenue and the water channel extending north from San Leandro Bay, separating the cities of Alameda and Oakland.     At the time of this case closure, the site is used as a trucking terminal with a maintenance building located near the western property boundary and accordingly this case is closed to the current commercial land-use risk scenario, consisting of a maintenance structure developed at the site.  Due to residual contamination, the site was closed with site management requirements that include notifying Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) of a proposed change in land use to any residential or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment or building alteration is proposed that affect or disturb the existing subsurface conditions at the site.    Adjacent Property(ies) Land-use at Time of Case Closure    At the time of this case closure, no potential off-site contamination was identified. However, should off-site redevelopment occur, ACDEH recommends evaluating the redevelopment site(s) for chemicals of concern identified on this site.    Historic Land-use \/ Site Investigation    Four USTs once operated at the site until the late 1980’s.  In June of 1986, two investigations were performed consisting of tank integrity testing and soil and groundwater sampling along with additional soil and groundwater sampling.  Based on tank integrity testing results two waste oil USTs and one diesel or formerly gasoline UST were removed.  Soil borings and groundwater monitoring wells were installed to determine whether the USTs have contaminated soil and groundwater beneath the site.  In July of 1987, the remaining diesel or formerly gasoline UST was removed.    In 1999, approximately 80 tons of stockpiled soil generated from the UST removals was disposed of under non-hazardous waste manifest to Forward Landfill in Manteca, California.  In 2012 soil borings were installed to collected soil and groundwater samples.  Additionally, soil vapor samples were also collected.  In 2014, passive soil vapor sampling probes were installed to delineate PCE detected in soil vapor.  In 2015, sewer lines and drain pipes were cleared to perform a video survey to determine whether floor drains and sewer lines are potential sources of light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) detected at the site.    Discovery of the PCE vapor contamination and petroleum Light Non Aqueous Phased Liquids (LNAPL) beneath the maintenance building delayed closure under the State Water Resource Control Board Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) in 2014.  No other investigation or cleanup was performed in relation to the USTs.    Investigation of the PCE contamination has been referred to another environmental case (RO0003134 and T10000005825).  Potential Exposure to Chemicals of Concern    The USTs that were used to store used oil, motor oil, diesel and gasoline are believed to be the source of the contamination discovered at the site.  The main chemicals of concern (COCs) associated with the USTs and detected at the site were TPH-d, TPH-g, BTEX, and PCE.  Inhalation and ingestion appear to have been the most likely potential routes of exposure to these COCs.    Remediation Activities    Source removal of the UST was performed at the site.  No additional corrective actions was performed at the site.    Case Closure &amp; Future Site Management Requirements     This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the LTCP.  The site fails the LTCP groundwater criteria as the nearest surface water body is less than 250 feet from the release, however plume concentrations in the downgradient well are below ESLs for the protectionof estuary habitats.  The site also fails the LTCP vapor intrusion criteria due to the presence of limited LNAPL beneath the maintenance building, the presence of groundwater at a depth of approximately 3.3 feet which precludes the collection of a soil vapor sample at a depth of 5 feet below the foundation (estimated at 6.5 feet below grade surface), the lack of a 5 foot bioattenuation zone, and the presence of TPH concentrations greater than 100 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) in the 0 to 5 foot depth interval.  Based on the collection of sub-slab petroleum hydrocarbon vapor samples ACDEH has concluded that petroleum vapors migrating from soil or groundwater will not have a significant risk of adversely affecting human health as a result of controlling the exposure through the use of an institutional land use control.  Finally, the case does not meet the Direct Contract and Outdoor Air criteria due to non-detectable PAHs above LTCP Table 1 values in the 0 to 5 foot depth interval.  However, ACDEH has made the determination that there is low potential threat to human health and safety and to the environment and water quality objectives will be achieved within a reasonable time frame.    Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed as a commercial site with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/www.acgov.org\/MAPS\/DEH\/InspectionResults\/.      Current Site Status:    The site is currently used as a residential\/commercial property with a commercial nursery and associated structures (greenhouses, garage, covered beds, etc.), a residence and paved parking areas.  The site is located in a mixed use neighborhood and is approximately 300 feet by 460 feet. Reports in the case file state that the site may be redeveloped in the future with residential structures however no redevelopment plans have been submitted to Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH).    Two soil, groundwater and soil gas investigations have been conducted at the site. Based on a review of the data (see site History below) further investigation is required to evaluate human health risk to soil vapor and groundwater.    No edf data, boring logs or maps have been uploaded to GeoTracker and thus the RP is out of compliance with State requirements.    Site History:    On November 25, 2014, one 1,000-gallon underground storage tank (UST), related product piping, and dispenser were removed from the subject site under permit from the Oakland Fire Department (OFD).  The OFD UST Closure\/Removal Report noted that the tank was corroded, obvious soil discoloration and odors were noted in the tank bed, and holes was observed in the tank. The tank was located adjacent to the garage in the paved parking area and approximately 40 feet from the residential structure, while the dispenser was located inside the garage. The tank was originally believed to have contained diesel but during the removal activities was found to contain gasoline. Three samples were collected, one beneath the dispenser (DISP-3) at 3 feet below ground surface (bgs) and two beneath the tank at depths of 7.5 and 8 feet bgs (EAST-7.5 and WEST-8). Samples were analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPH-g), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX), methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE), di-isopropyl ether (DIPE), tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME), tert butyl alcohol (TBA) and lead. Concentrations up to 10.6 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) ethylbenzene, 48.3 mg\/kg total xylenes, 497 mg\/kg TPH-g were detected in soil taken from beneath the UST. No constituents were detected above laboratory reporting limits from the sample collected beneath the dispenser. Total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPH-d) was not included in the suite of analysis. No over-excavation was conducted and the tank was backfilled with excavated overburden soil and clean imported baserock. Based upon these results, this Fuel Leak Case No. RO 0003156 was opened by ACDEH.      In September 2015 and April 2016 two soil, soil gas and groundwater investigations were conducted. A total of 11 onsite borings (DP-1 through DP-11) have been advanced and grab groundwater and soil samples collected for analysis of TPHg, TPHd, BTEX, MTBE and napthalene. Four temporary soil gas probes were installed (SG-1 through SG-4) for collection and analysis of soil gas samples for volatile organic compounds, oxygen, and helium.    Soil encountered during the investigations was identified predominately as Silty Clay from the ground surface to 12 to 13 feet bgs. Groundwater was first encountered within coarser grained materials described as Clayey Sand to Clayey Gravelly Sand at depths of 10.5 to 13 feet bgs and subsequently rose to a static level as high as 3.90 feet bgs. Groundwater flow direction has been surmised to be to the west\/southwest based on topography of the area however no groundwater wells have been installed at the site to confirm this.    Based on the results of the samples collected during removal of the tank and dispenser and the 16 soil samples collected at 5 and 10 feet bgs from eight borings (DP-1 through DP-8) during subsequent field investigations the lateral extent of soil impact appears to have been delineated and is limited mainly to the area directly around the former UST pit and dispenser.  Petroleum hydrocarbon constituents were detected at concentrations above the laboratory reporting limits in samples DP-2d10.0, DP-4d5.0, DP-4d10.0 located within approximately 15 feet of the former tank with maximum concentrations of 0.049 mg\/kg benzene, 1.6 mg\/kg toluene, 8.2 mg\/kg xylenes and 1.3 mg\/kg naphthalene in DP-4d10.0. All other soil samples had concentrations below the laboratory reporting limit with the exception of sample DP-5d10.0 located approximately 45 feet downgradient of the former UST and dispenser which had a concentration of 0.045 mg\/kg naphthalene. The vertical extent of the soil contamination has not been delineated as no samples have been collected below 10 feet where the highest impacts are found and soil discoloration and petroleum odors are noted.       Four temporary soil gas probes have been installed at the site in the vicinity of the source area and one round of soil gas samples collected. Probe SG-1 was installed between boring DP-2 and the eastern end of the former tank pit adjacent to sample EAST-7.5; probe SG-2 was installed adjacent to DP-4; probe SG-3 was installed adjacent to DP-5; and probe SG-4 was installed in the vicinity of the former dispenser near sample DISP-3. Benzene concentrations in soil gas samples collected from SG-1 (3,800 ug\/m3), SG-2 (5,900 ug\/m3) and SG-4 (18,000 ug\/m3) exceed both the commercial and residential Low Threat Closure Policy (LTCP) soil gas criteria (no bioattenuation zone) of 85 ug\/m3 and 280 ug\/m3, respectively. The ethylbenzene concentration in the soil gas sample collected from SG-4 (5,400 ug\/m3) exceeds the LTCP criteria of 1,100 ug\/m3 (residential) and 3,600 ug\/m3 (commercial). Naphthalene concentrations for samples collected from all four soil gas probes were reported as non-detects however the laboratory reporting limits were above the residential and commercial LTCP soil gas criteria. Additionally, TPHg concentrations in soil gas samples collected from probes SG-2 (340,000 ug\/m3) and SG-4 (680,000 ug\/m3) exceed the residential soil gas environmental screening level of 300,000 ug\/m3. In accordance with the LTCP criteria the no bioattenuation zone criteria apply unless the requirements for a bioattenuation zone are established. Sufficient data has not been collected to support that there is a bioattenuation zone at the site including 5 feet of unsaturated soil beneath the foundation of site structures with TPH (gas and diesel) concentrations less than 100 mg\/kg (measured in at least two depths within the five-foot zone)    Grab groundwater samples collected from 11 borings had detectable concentrations of TPHg, TPHd, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes and naphthalene with the maximum concentrations detected in two of the borings located adjacent to the former tank pit and dispenser island . The maximum concentrations were detected in soil boring DP-4 which had concentrations of 9,700 ug\/l TPHg, less than 2,900 ug\/l TPHd, 380 ug\/l benzene, 2,800 ug\/l toluene, 1,100 ug\/l ethylbenzene, 4,700 ug\/l xylenes and 210 ug\/l naphthalene. The lateral extent of the TPHg groundwater plume has not been defined to water quality objectives to the north, south or east as the laboratory reporting limits are greater than 500 ug\/L.  The ethylbenzene and napthalene groundwater plume has also not been defined  north of DP-2. The nearest surface water body is San Leandro Creek and is located approximately 1,000 feet south of the site. A well survey found three wells within a 1,000 foot radius of the site. One of the wells is located on the subject property and is reported to be less that 250 feet from the edge of the contamination plume, however the location of the three wells and the distances to the plume boundary could not be confirmed as the lateral extent of the plume has not been definedand a scaled figure with the contaminant isoconcentration contours and the location of the wells has not been provided. The onsite well is listed as a \"monitoring well\" within the Alameda County Public Works Agency database but it is reported to have been used by the former onsite nursery as a source of water for irrigation. No information has been provided on the current use of the well.",

The gasoline station in the southwest portion of the Property (6710 Bancroft Avenue) was present  from the 1960s through the 1980s. No records regarding gasoline underground storage tank (UST) removals or soil sampling were discovered during the records review and there was no indication that the petroleum release was from a former UST system. Additional site investigations to delineate COCs in groundwater and were completed in Spring 2019. Petroleum - motor oil detected in soils at concentrations exceeding ESLs at three locations (less than 2.5 feet bgs). RP plans to remove soil \"hot spots\" during redevelopment construction. Results were used to evaluate site eligibility for UST Low Threat Closure; closure cannot be completed until soil removals are completed and documented. .",

Elevated petroleum hydrocarbons were reported in soil collected from the excavation sidewalls.  In June 1992, one 10,000-gallon diesel UST was removed.  Groundwater contained 72,000 µg\/L TPHd.  Monitoring wells were installed in 1994.  Free product was observed in MW-4 in the June 2002 monitoring event.  Free product bailing and adsorbent socks were deployed.  Groundwater monitoring discontinued in 2003.      The site was evaluated for case closure under the State Water Resources Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy and was closed on May 20, 2014.  Based upon the information available in our files to date, no further investigation or cleanup for the fuel leak case is necessary at this time.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "A preliminary site review was conducted by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) for the subject site located at 4201 Bancroft Avenue, Assessor Parcel Number 35-2353-24-2.  The preliminary review was requested by the current property owner to discuss potential redevelopment activities at the Site.  A kick-off meeting with the responsible party (RP) and their environmental consultant (EC) was held at the offices of ACDEH on September 26, 2018.  Based on discussions during the meeting, ACDEH understands redevelopment activities may consist of commercial or mixed-use, however, no conceptual redevelopment plans have been drafted and the property is currently not in any entitlement phase.    ACDEH notes the property located to the south, 4200 International Blvd, and the subject Site were formally one parcel (APN: 35-2353-1-2).  In November 2017 the entire parcel underwent a lot line adjustment and was split into two parcels (4200 International Blvd.; APN: 35-235-1-2 and 4201 Bancroft Ave.; APN: 35-2353-24-2) and sold to two separate buyers.  The 4200 International Blvd property is currently a Site Cleanup Program case (RO0003261) which is in the process of closure under regulatory oversight by ACDEH.    A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment dated May 31, 2017 was prepared for the 4200 International Blvd. property which indicated historical operations conducted at the subject Site included various commercial configurations of auto repair, remanufacturing, auto body, auto parts cleaner, and auto painting businesses.  Recognized environmental conditions (RECs) observed at the Site included a former paint booth shed; various hazardous waste storage racks without secondary containment; auto repair drains and sumps; above and below ground hydraulic lifts, an underground concrete pit, and various degreasing areas.      Subsurface activities were conducted at the Site in October 2017 to evaluate the extent and magnitude of subsurface potential chemicals of concern (PCOCs).  Site investigations included the advancement of five soil borings (SB-1 through SB-5) and collection of soil samples and five grab groundwater samples (GGW-1 through GGW-5).  Soil samples were analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline (TPH-g), diesel (TPH-d), and motor oil (TPH-mo), volatile- and semi-volatile organic compound (VOCs and SVOCs), and Title 22 metals.  Soil samples were collected from two foot below ground surface (bgs) and ten-foot bgs intervals.  Soil observed at SB-2 and SB-5 reported elevated photo ionized detector (PID) readings which resulted in the collection of additional deeper ten-foot bgs samples.  TPH-d, TPH-mo, acetone and metals concentrations were reported above their laboratory detection limits.  Arsenic and Lead in soil was reported above their respectively February 2016 San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board’s Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) for commercial land use.  The five grab groundwater samples were analyzed for TPH-g, TPH-d, TPH-mo, VOCs, and SVOCs.  TPH-d was reported in all groundwater samples above their laboratory detection limits and above their Tier 1 ESLs at four out of the five grab samples (GWW-1 and GWW-3 through GWW-5).    Based on results of the subsurface investigation and discussions in the meeting with ACDEH, no data has been presented to address a potential vapor intrusion risk under the current configuration from identified RECs.  Additionally, ACDEH notes additional subsurface investigations are warranted to sufficiently evaluate currently identified RECs and potential Site redevelopment.",

Four borings were advanced, one on each side of the tank, to maximum depths of 20 feet bgs.  The maximum concentrations in soil were 9,600 mg\/kg TPHg, 4,500 mg\/kg TPHd, and 18,000 mg\/kg Oil and Grease.  No benzene or MTBE were detected.  After the investigation was performed, the UST was closed in place.  Groundwater was not collected at this time.     An SWI conducted in 2014 reported TPHg up to 640 mg\/kg19 mg\/kg TPHd, and 38 mg\/kg TPHmo.  Benzene, toluene, and MTBE  were ND, Max ethyl benzene, xylenes and naphthalene concentrations were reported at 0.16, 0.65, and 0.12 mg\/kg, respectively. Max  GGW concentrations were reported at 2,400 ug\/L TPHg, 600 ug\/L TPHd, and 1,400 ug\/L TPHmo.   Benzene, toluene, and MTBE  were ND, Max ethyl benzene, xylenes and naphthalene concentrations were reported at 60, 210, and 9.1 ug\/L, respectively.    The site is currently being redeveloped with remediation and mitigation for petroleum and non-petroleum constituents of concern being handled under a Site Cleanup Program Case. Construction dewatering is anticipated to be conducted for the duration of Site development activities. Because of this disruption to hydrogeological conditions at and in the vicinity of the Site, ACDEH has stalled further characterization until after active dewatering activities are no longer being conducted.",

Site investigation activities conducted on site included: Stockpile Sampling SS-1 to SS-3 (1995); advancement of 19 direct push borings S-1 through S-19 (2004); advancement of eight soil borings GP1 through GP8 (2006); installation of SB-1 through SB-11 and installation of groundwater monitoring wells MW-1 to MW-5 (2013); installation of groundwater monitoring wells MW-6 to MW-8 (2014); installation of temporary soil vapor sampling points SV-1 to SV-5 (February 2017); installation and monitoring of permanent soil vapor monitoring points SV-1A, SV-2A, SV-4A (July 2017). Semi-annual groundwater monitor and sampling was conducted 2013 through 2017.    Analytical data from soil, groundwater and soil vapor samples indicated that the subsurface beneath the site had been impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons and fuel-related constituents including, but not limited TPHg, TPHd, BTEX, and naphthalene. Analyses of halogenated VOCs, SVOCs, and metals were additionally conducted on soil and groundwater samples during the investigations.    This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH determined that the site met all the LTCP General Criteria and Media Specific Criteria. Therefore, case closure is granted for the current commercial land use as a vacant lot with no structures or buildings.  If a change in land use to any residential, commercial other than as a vacant lot with no structures or buildings, or conservative land use, or if any site redevelopment is planned, Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  Any below grade work require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.",

Two tank pit soil samples were collected by AEI at a depth of 8 feet below grade (fbg) following removal of the UST and analyzed for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as Gasoline (TPH-G), methyl tertiarybutyl ether (MTBE), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), and lead. Groundwater was not encountered in the UST pit at the time of UST removal. The sample collected at the west end of the UST pit (closest to the intersection of 77th Avenue and Hawley Street) contained 4,600 mg\/kg TPH-G and 4.5 mg\/kg benzene. The sample collected at the east end of the UST contained 310 mg\/kg TPH-G, and benzene was not detected.

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Current Land-use at time of Case Closure  The subject property (APN 5-478-23) is located 3516 Adeline Street, in the northwest portion of the City of Oakland, approximately one mile east of San Francisco bay, 60 feet of Interstate 580, and ¾ mile west of Interstate 580\/980 interchange.  The site occupies the southeast corner of Adeline and 35th Streets.  At the time of this case closure, City of Paris Studios is operating a gallery and event space on the western portion of the site, and live-work studios on the eastern portion of the site.  Accordingly this case is closed with the current eastern live-work residential development footprint and western commercial land-use risk scenario.  Due to residual contamination, the site was closed with site management requirements that include notifying Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) of a proposed change in land use to any residential or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment or building alteration is proposed that affect or disturb the existing subsurface conditions at the site.    Adjacent Property’s Land-use at Time of Case Closure  At the time of this case closure, potential off-site contamination is likely beneath 35th and Adeline Streets, but does not appear to be extend onto properties across 35th and Adeline Streets.  However, should off-site redevelopment occur, ACDEH recommends evaluating the redevelopment site(s) for chemicals of concern identified on this site.    Historic Land-use \/ Site Investigation  The site has historically operated as a dry cleaning business.  Four underground storage tanks (USTs) used to store Stoddard Solvent (chemical used in the dry cleaning industry) were present at the site.  Three of these tanks (one 750-gallon and two 1,000-gallon USTs) were excavated and removed from the site in October 1990.  Soil samples collected from underneath the former USTs identified contamination.  In August 1991, the eastern portion of the UST pit was over-excavated to remove contaminated soil.  In that process, a 250-gallon UST containing Stoddard Solvent was encountered and subsequently removed.  The stockpiled soil was remediated onsite and was used to backfill the excavation.    To assess whether the groundwater has been contaminated, three groundwater monitoring wells were installed in October 1992.  Stoddard solvent was detected in groundwater samples collected from each well.    In March 1998, six exploratory borings were installed to collected soil and groundwater samples downgradient near the excavation boundary and across the 35th Street.  Groundwater contamination was detected on and off-site.    In April and May 2011, additional investigation of soil, soil vapor, and groundwater was performed to verify natural attenuation, a preferential pathway evaluation was conducted, and a sensitive receptor survey was performed.  An Industrial Well (W-IND) is located on site.    In May 2013 additional investigation of soil and groundwater was performed to determine the extent of the soil and groundwater plume towards Adeline Street in the predominate downgradient direction.    In August 2015, an additional soil vapor investigation was conducted to determine the risk of vapor intrusion to the City of Paris Studio building due to methane vapors.    Exposure to Chemicals of Concern  Stoddard Solvent is understood to be the source of UST contamination discovered and cleaned up at the site.  The main chemicals of concern (COCs) associated with the Stoddard Solvent USTs and detected at the site were total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as Stoddard Solvent (ss), TPH as gasoline (g), benzene, ethylbenzene, and naphthalene.  Inhalation and ingestion appear to have been the most likely potential routes of exposure to these COCs.  Direct contact may also be an exposure route.    Remediation Activities  Corrective action consisting of excavation of the USTs and contaminated soil has been completed.  Confirmation soil sample analytical results indicated residual petroleum hydrocarbons remain in soil and groundwater.    Case Closure &amp; Future Site Management Requirements  This fuel leak case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP).  The case does not meet the Groundwater Media Specific criterion due to the presence of an offsite downgradient abandoned private water supply well at a distance of approximately 770 feet from the downgradient property line.  ACDEH has made the determination that there is low potential threat to human health and safety and to the environment and water quality objectives will be achieved within a reasonable time frame.    Due to residual contamination at the site, the site is closed to its current live-work residential development footprint and commercial land-use with site management requirements.  If there is a proposed change in land use to any residential, or conservative land use, or if any redevelopment occurs, ACDEH must be notified as required by Government Code Section 65850.2.2.  ACDEH will re-evaluate the site relative to the proposed redevelopment.  Excavation or construction activities in areas of residual contamination require planning and implementation of appropriate health and safety procedures by the responsible party prior to and during excavation and construction activities.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The site is a triangle shaped property formed by the junctions of 51st Street, 52nd Street, and Telegraph Avenue.  Previously, the site was occupied by a Chevron service station from 1970 to 1991.  The site is currently occupied by a business center containing three commercial buildings and associated landscaping and parking.  Surrounding land use is commercial and residential.  Soils encountered at the site during investigation consisted of interbedded layers of silt, clay, sand, and gravel with varying amounts of other soil types.    On November 14 and 15, 1990, soil borings C-1 through C-4 were advanced and completed as monitoring wells.  Soil samples were collected from the borings at approximately 10 and 15 feet below ground surface (fbgs).  Groundwater samples were also collected from the developed monitoring wells.  Soil collected from boring C-3, located near in the southwest portion of the site contained the greatest contaminant concentration of 270 ppm Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg).  The greatest constituent concentrations were detected in groundwater wells C-1 and C-2, with detections up to 1,900 ppb TPHg and 140 ppb benzene.    On September 18, 1991, two 10,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tank (UST), one 5,000-gallon gasoline UST, and one 1,000-gallon waste oil tank were removed from the site along with their associated piping.  Fifteen soil samples were collected from the tank excavation pits and product line trenches.  Additional composite soil samples were collected from the soil stockpiles.  Soil samples collected from the gasoline UST excavation contained up to 1,300 ppm TPHg and 0.33 ppm benzene.  Soil samples collected from the product line trench and waste oil tank excavation contained up to 53 ppm TPHg and &lt; 50 ppm Total Oil and Grease (TOG), respectively.  The gasoline UST and product line excavations were subsequently overexcavated to 17.5 and 5 fbgs, respectively.  Further overexcavation and subsequent soil sampling of the UST cavity documented detectable concentrations up to 980 ppm TPHg and 0.069 ppm benzene in the UST overexcavation at a depth of 15 feet bgs, and up to 2 ppm TPHg and 0.069 ppm benzene in the product line overexcavation at 5 feet bgs.  Subsequent waste oil UST stockpile soil sampling also documented a concentration of 78 ppm TPHd, which was characterized as containing heavier hydrocarbons than diesel.   Approximately 600 cubic yards of soil were removed; 300 cubic yards were disposed offsite and 300 were aerated, sampled, and re-used as backfill material.    On November 30 and December 1, 1992, five soil borings (TC-1 through TC-5) were advanced offsite to determine the extent of lateral contamination.  A total of ten soil samples were collected from the borings at depths ranging from 7 to 16 fbgs.  Grab groundwater samples were also collected from each boring.  Petroleum hydrocarbon compounds were detected in TC-4 and TC-5.  TPHg, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes were detected in soil samples collected from upgradient bore TC-4 at concentrations up to 46 ppm, 0.18 ppm, 0.12 ppm, and 0.07 ppm, respectively.  The grab groundwater samples from upgradient bore TC-4, and crossgradient bore TC-5 detected TPHg concentrations of 120,000 ppb and 2,400 ppb, respectively.  Ethylbenzene and xylenes were also detected in the groundwater sample from boring TC-4 at 500 ppb and 400 ppb, respectively.  Benzene was not detected in any of the grab groundwater samples, including downgradient of the subject site.  Thus, the investigation predominately documented petroleum hydrocarbon contamination at the upgradient site (5200 Telegraph Avenue; Autopro, RO0000323, T0600100131), located approximately 250 feet directly upgradient of the subject site.    On September 15, 16, and 19, 1993, five offsite borings (B-1 through B-5) were advanced offsite and completed as monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-5).  The purpose of this investigation was to define the extent of contamination documented in borings TC-4 and TC-5.  Concentrations up to 300 ppm TPHg (in downgradient well B-3 \/ MW-3) and 0.007 ppm benzene (in upgradient well B-4 \/ MW-4) were documented.   The highest concentrations of TPHg in grab groundwater samples were detected from wells upgradient (MW-4) near 5200 Telegraph Avenue (Autopro, RO0000323, T0600100131) and downgradient (MW-3) of the site.  Groundwater samples from the completed monitoring wells contained up to 6,600 ppb TPHg and 400 ppb benzene.    Wells C-1, C-2, and C-4 were destroyed in 1996 and 1997 during site redevelopment.  Oxygen Releasing Compound (ORC) socks were placed in monitoring wells C-3 and MW-3 from 1999 to 2004.  Upgradient well MW-4 has been renamed MW-5, is monitored periodically in site investigations for the upgradient site (Autopro, RO0000323, T0600100131), and has not been monitored recently by Chevron.    Groundwater monitoring has been conducted at the site since December 1990 and was most recent conducted in September 2012.  Results of the groundwater monitoring indicate that a groundwater plume consisting primarily of TPHg and TPHd extends from 5200 Telegraph Avenue (Autopro, RO0000323, T0600100131) approximately 150 feet southwest (downgradient) towards the subject site (5101 Telegraph Avenue).  Diesel is not reported to have been dispensed at the subject site and except for three waste oil UST confirmation soil samples has not been analyzed for at the subject site.  Recent detections from monitoring wells located at the Autopro site (RO0000323, T0600100131) at 5200 Telegraph Ave. indicate 1,800 ppb TPHg and 1,500 ppb TPHd are present.  Recent detections from monitoring wells associated with the subject site indicate that residual contamination is present in groundwater onsite and downgradient of the site (in well C-3 and MW-3 at between 4,300 to 4,500 ppb TPHg and &lt; 0.5 to 1 ppb benzene).  The downgradient extent appears to be defined by historic data at former wells MW-1 and MW-3 located at the Berkeley Land Company (RO0000691) at 5100 Telegraph Avenue south and southwest of the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Site investigation activities were conducted between 1991 and 2000 to evaluate the extent of subsurface impacts to soil and groundwater from the releases identified in 1991, and 1997. The investigations included collection and analysis of soil samples collected from 10 soil bores (B1 through B10); and groundwater samples from three groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-3).  The extent of the unauthorized release of TPHho and other PCOCs related to hydraulic hoists was not delineated as part of the LUST case.    Site investigation activities were conducted between 2007 and 2017 to evaluate the extent of subsurface impacts to soil, soil gas and groundwater from the UST system release discovered in 2002. Site investigation activities included installation of three cone penetrometer test bores (H1-CPT through H3-CPT) and the collection and analysis of soil samples from 25 soil bores (B11 through B21, H1, H3, MW-4 through MW-9, V-1 through V-6); groundwater samples from six monitoring wells (MW-4 through MW-9), one groundwater extraction well (RW1), and 14 soil bores (B11 through B21, H1 through H3); and vapor samples from six soil vapor monitoring probes (V1 through V-6). Analytical data from soil, groundwater and soil vapor samples indicated that the subsurface beneath the site had been impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons, primarily TPHg, BTEX and MTBE\/TBA.    Approximately 1,200 cubic yards of fill and native soil were excavated from the gasoline UST pit in 1991 and an unknown volume of impacted soil was excavated from the waste oil UST pit and the hydraulic hoist areas in 1997. Excavated soil was transported offsite to a permitted facility for disposal. No other remediation was conducted at the site.    In 2002, an additional 140 cubic yards of fill and native soil was excavated from the gasoline UST pit and 9,000 gallons of tank pit infiltration water was removed. Excavated soil and impacted groundwater were transported offsite to a permitted facility for disposal. A groundwater pump test was conducted in 2011 to assess the feasibility of groundwater pump and treat as a remediation strategy. Two tests were conducted over a 91 hour period test and approximately 1,043 gallons of water were pumped from extraction well RW1. No other remediation was conducted at the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is a small triangular commercial property located at the intersection of Harrison Street and Bay Place in Oakland, CA.  The site was previously a Shell gas station and auto repair facility equipped with three underground storage tanks (USTs), one 550-gallon waste oil tank UST, three dispenser islands, a drive-on hoist, and a station building.  The USTs were removed from the center of the property in March 1977, but no records are available that document their removal.  Three dispenser islands existed to the west, north, and east of the former USTs.  Currently, the site is occupied by a 7-Eleven convenience store and the surrounding area is predominantly a mix of commercial and residential use.      During a light pole installation at the site, petroleum impacted soil was observed.  Composite stockpile soil samples were collected on November 2, 1992 from the soil generated during the light pole removal and analyzed for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes (BTEX), lubricating oil, and other heavier petroleum hydrocarbons.  The soil sample collected from Soil Pile 1 contained the highest concentrations of 3,200 parts per million (ppm) lubricating oil and 35 ppm Oil and grease (O&amp;G).    On March 4, 1993, four soil borings (#1 through #4) were advanced at locations across the site.  One soil sample from each boring was analyzed for TPHg, TPHd, BTEX, O&amp;G, Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as kerosene (TPHk), Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as mineral spirits (TPHms), and lubricating oil.  The maximum concentrations of 7,900 ppm TPHmo and 620 ppm TPHg were detected in the soil sample from boring #4, in the east portion of the site.    Six monitoring wells (S-1 through S-6) were installed throughout the site on June 2 through 5, 2008.  Soil samples were collected from each boring between 5.5 and 15.5 fbgs, along with one groundwater sample.  Groundwater was first encountered at the site between 8.2 and 19 fbgs.  The soil samples indicated that the highest concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons occurred in shallow soils between 7 and 10 fbgs.  Shallow soils in the southeast portion of the site contained up to 2,300 ppm TPHg, 22,000 ppm TPHd, and 8,600 ppm O&amp;G.  Shallow soils near the western-most dispenser contained up to 2,700 ppm TPHg and 270 ppm TPHd.  Groundwater samples collected from the former UST area and southeast corner of the site contained TPHg concentrations of 6,500 parts per billion (ppb) and 1,300 ppb, respectively.    To investigate the potential for the petroleum plume to extend off-site, two grab groundwater samples (HP-1 and HP-2) were collected down gradient along Harrison Street on May 19 through 21, 2009.  The grab groundwater sample collected furthest from the site (HP-2) contained 715,000 ppb O&amp; G, 14,000 ppb TPHg, and 58,000 ppb TPHd, while the closer groundwater sample (HP-1) contained 111,000 ppb O&amp;G. 11,000 ppb TPHg and 36,000 ppb TPHd.  The grab groundwater samples indicated the potential for an offsite plume of heavier hydrocarbons.  In addition to the off-site samples, four soil borings (B-1 through B-4) were advanced in the former waste oil tank area.  The shallow soil sample collected from boring B-1 at 5.5 fbgs contained the highest concentration of O&amp;G at 3,000 ppm.  TPHg and TPHd were detected in all borings at maximum concentrations of 920 ppm and 700 ppm, respectively.  Three soil vapor probes (SVP-1 through SVP-3) were also installed near the former USTs and waste oil UST and sampled on May 28, 2009.  The vapor probes contained up to 530,000 micrograms per cubic meter (µg\/m3) benzene.    On February 27, 2010, one soil vapor probe (SVP-2a) and two near sub-slab vapor probes (SVP-4 and SVP-5) were installed.  Sampling of the vapor probes on occurred on March 23, 2010. TPHg and benzene were detected in soil vapor near the former USTs at concentrations up to 75,000,000 µg\/m3 and 160,000 µg\/m3, respectively.  Soil vapor samples from the two near sub-slab probes did not contain TPHg, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, or xylenes (BTEX) at concentrations above the reporting limit.    On June 25, 2010, six soil borings (B-5 through B-10) were advanced off-site to investigate contamination south of the site.  The investigation revealed a large plume of petroleum hydrocarbons south of the site consisting of O&amp;G, TPHd, and TPHg at maximum groundwater concentrations of 715,000 ppb, 58,000 ppb, and 14,000 ppb, respectively.  The highest concentrations were detected along Harrison Street approximately 175 feet southwest of the site   The plume does not contain BTEX or other VOCs at concentrations above reporting limits.  Since the maximum concentrations within the plume were detected approximately 175 feet downgradient from the site and the types of petroleum hydrocarbons are not consistent with the dissolved phase hydrocarbons detected on site, the plume is most likely from an off-site source.  In 2011, a review of historical aerial photos and Sanborn maps identified five potential sources for the off-site heavy petroleum hydrocarbon plume.      On March 30, 2011, soil vapor probes SVP-3 through SVP-5 were sampled.  Soil vapor probes SVP-1, SVP-2, and SVP-2a could not be sampled due to water in the sampling tubing.  Due to anomalous results of up to 190,000 µg\/m3 TPHg in near sub-slab vapor probes SVP-4 and SVP-5, the probes were re-sampled on June 8, 2011.  The re-sampling of probes SVP-4 and SVP-5 indicated non-detectable concentrations of TPHg and 2.2 µg\/m3 benzene were present in the near sub-slab wells.  Probe SVP-3, located less than five feet north of near sub-slab probe SVP-5, contained 26,000,000 µg\/m3 TPHg, 1,400 µg\/m3 benzene, and 1,700 µg\/m3 xylenes.    An air exchange rate test was performed on the existing convenience store building on December 19, 2011.  The initial measurements of the air exchange rate indicated an overall average of 3.11 exchanges per hour.  Due to a relatively low air exchange rate, the test was followed by system maintenance which increased the HVAC performance to an air exchange rate of 11.49 exchanges per hour.  The minimum required air exchange rate was calculated to determine the potential for intrusion of benzene from soil vapor to indoor air to exceed the commercial indoor air Environmental Screening Level (ESL).  Using site data and assumptions from EPA and RWQCB documents, the calculated necessary air exchange rate to prevent benzene vapor intrusion at concentrations exceeding the indoor air ESL is 2.3 exchanges per hour.  The current air exchange rate is greater than the calculated minimum air exchange rate by a factor of 5.",

The former Site layout consisted of a station building, three 12,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs) containing gasoline, four dispenser islands, and a car wash. Site features, including the UST fueling system, were decommissioned in December 2015; additional product piping was later uncovered during construction activities and subsequently removed in May 2018. Construction of the current service station was completed in 2018.  The case was opened by Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) to determine if detections of naphthalene and total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel (TPH-d) reported during the removal of conveyance piping in 2015 and 2018 are associated with a historic release at the Site or are indicative of the presence of a new release. In order to address the ACDEH’s concerns regarding whether diesel-range hydrocarbons and naphthalene are representative of a new or historic release, three groundwater samples were collected up- and down-gradient of the former USTs to evaluate current conditions of groundwater beneath the Site. Based on the results of the groundwater samples collected during the May 2021 investigation, ACDEH concurs that the data support the assessment that Site closure is appropriate.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Land use surrounding the site is mixed commercial and residential.  Known use of the site dates back to at least 1903, when the property was used the site of the Sisters of Providence Hospital.  Beginning sometime in 1950, the site was occupied by a used car sales\/service facility.  Underground storage tanks (USTs) were reportedly installed in the western portion of the site in 1962, when the site was first occupied by a fuel service station.  A restaurant was also constructed on the eastern portion of the property sometime between 1958 and 1968.  In 1998, the fuel service station was demolished, the USTs were removed, and the site was paved.  The paved lot has remained to the present day and the site is now occupied by Audi of Oakland car sales facility and a vacant, circular building (the former restaurant).    Residual impacted fill material appears to remain from the demolition of the former hospital.  The nature and extent of contamination from the former hospital is currently uncharacterized.  A new case will be created for contamination related to the former hospital.  Lead and SVOC contamination from the former hospital is not considered a part of this UST closure.    On March 18, 1982, eight soil borings were advanced to 20 feet below ground surface (bgs) and completed as monitoring wells (B-1 through B-8).   No soil samples were collected from the well borings for laboratory analysis.  Groundwater was first encountered between 8 and 25 feet bgs.  Groundwater was then observed to raise within four to eight feet bgs. A trace odor of gasoline was observed on the drill cuttings from borings B-2 and B-5.  The concentrations of combustible gases and percentage of the lower explosive limit (LEL) were also measured in each well.    On April 21, 1982, two 7,500-gallon gasoline, one 4,000-gallon gasoline, one 1,000-gallon waste oil UST, and associated piping are reported to have been replaced  with new fiberglass tanks (three 10,000-gallon gasoline and one 1,000-gallon used-oil) and piping at the site.   The steel tanks are reported to have been installed in 1962, 1971, 1974, and 1981.  No other information is available.   Approximately 20 cubic yards of soil and 2,000 gallons of groundwater are reported to have been removed and disposed at an offsite location.  Observation wells TP-1 and TP-2 were installed in the new tanks’ backfill.  In May 1982, approximately 2.5 feet of light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) was observed in well B-4.  LNAPL was then bailed from well B-4 on a weekly basis from August 1982 to February 1983, when LNAPL was no longer observed in the well.    On August 7, 1983, slow pumping was reported in the mid-grade gasoline product line.  The line was tested, found to be leaking just east of the gasoline USTs, and replaced on August 9th.  According to inventory records, up to 20 gallons of product was lost.  A follow-up groundwater monitoring event was conducted on September 9, 1993.  TPHg and benzene were detected in groundwater at concentrations up to 110,000 ppb and 3,200 ppb, respectively.  The greatest TPHg and benzene concentrations were detected in wells B-4 and B-5, located east of the USTs.    On July 26 and 27, 1994, four exploratory borings were advanced onsite (B-9) and offsite (B-10 through B-12) to approximately 20 feet bgs.  The borings were completed as monitoring wells and sampled on August 4, 1994.  Soil samples were collected from the borings between five and eleven feet bgs.  Groundwater was first encountered in the wells at approximately 17 to 18 feet bgs.  Static groundwater was measured in the new wells between 6.5 and 11.5 feet bgs.  Soil samples collected during the event contained up to 90 ppm TPHg and no detectable concentrations of benzene.  Theonly detectable petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater in new wells were from well B-9 at concentrations of 650 ppb TPHg and 4.4 ppb benzene.    On March 10, 1998, three 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs, one 1,000-gallon waste oil UST, two semi-hydraulic hoists, and all associated piping were removed from the site.  No holes were observed in any of the USTs or associated piping.  Groundwater was encountered in the gasoline UST excavation at a depth of approximately 11 feet bgs.  Approximately 4,000 gallons of groundwater was pumped from the excavation and disposed offsite.  Soil samples were collected from the gasoline UST excavation (TX1 through TX8), waste oil excavation (UO1 and UO2), piping trench (P1 through P11), hydraulic hoist excavation (H1 and H2), and stockpiled soil (SP-1(a-d), SP-2(a-d), and UOSP-1(a-d)).  Soil waste generated during this event was analyzed and deemed appropriate to be used as backfill.  Although it is not documented, the observation wells previously installed in the tank pit (TP-1 and TP-2) and well B-2 were apparently destroyed during this event.    Analysis of soil samples collected from the gasoline UST excavation detected up to 340 ppm TPHg, with highest concentrations along the eastern sidewall.  The product dispenser soil samples collected from the southernmost dispenser contained the highest concentration of TPHg, with 1,200 ppm detected.  Total Oil and Grease (TOG) was detected in the hydraulic hoist and waste oil UST excavation samples at concentrations up to 310 ppm and 110 ppm, respectively.  Lead was also detected in the product trench and waste oil UST excavation bottom confirmation soil samples at concentrations of 5,000 ppm and 6,800 ppm, respectively.    On November 19, 1998, soil was excavated from former locations of the used oil UST and from each dispenser island.  Test pits were also excavated to investigate lead contamination in soil.  Soil samples were collected from the bottom of the excavations (PX2, PX5, and PX7 through PX10), from fill material in the former waste oil excavation (UOSP-2(a &amp; b)), and from the stockpiled soil (SP-3(a-d)).  Additional excavation of the former waste oil UST location was not conducted.  Similar to the previous excavation event, product dispenser soil samples collected from the southernmost dispenser contained the highest concentration of TPHg (1,190 ppm).  Lead was detected in stockpiled soil from the former waste oil UST excavation at a concentration of 1,790 ppm.  Confirmation samples collected at the bottom of the additional product line excavation contained &lt; 7.5 ppm (non detectable) concentrations of lead.  Approximately 160 cubic yards of contaminated soil was removed from the former dispenser areas and disposed offsite.    During this investigation, old fill material consisting of burnt wood, bricks, ashes, and concrete was encountered in the northern excavation areas.  Concrete footings and basement floor slabs were also discovered.  The fill material and foundation appear to be associated with the former Sisters of Providence Hospital that existed at the site.  Field observations indicated that the lead contamination (up to 6,800 ppm) detected in the former used-oil tank excavation and in the northern dispenser island excavation (up to 5,000 ppm); and likely the detections of semi-VOCs (up to 2.3 ppm bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate and other SVOCs), appeared to be associated with the fill material observed in these areas and unrelated to the former service station activities.  The impacted fill material appears to remain from the demolition of the former hospital.  The nature and extent of contamination from the former hospital is currently uncharacterized.  A new case will be created for contamination related to the former hospital.  Lead and SVOC contamination from the former hospital is not considered a part of this UST closure.    On July 29, 1999, Oxygen Reducing Compound (ORC) socks were installed in wells B-1, B-3, B-5 through B-7, and B-9.  Nine to sixteen socks were installed in each well.  Subsequent groundwater monitoring results showed a decrease of TPHg concentrations in groundwater.  Concentrations of TPHg in wells B-1, B-3, and B-9 rebounded to concentrations at or above post-ORC sock installations within approximately one year.  In wells B-1, B-3, and B-5, an increase of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) concentrations was observed in groundwater subsequent to the ORC sock installations.   On June 6 and 7, 2007, three onsite borings (B-13, B-14, and B-21) and six offsite borings (B-15 through B-20) were installed.  Borings B-13, B-15, and B-16 were not completed due to obstruction by a concrete slab encountered between four and six feet bgs, and apparently associated with the former hospital.  Soil samples were collected from each completed boring at five-foot intervals.  Grab groundwater samples were also collected from each completed boring except boring B-21.  Neither the soil samples nor the groundwater samples contained detectable concentrations of TPHg or benzene.  MTBE was detected in grab groundwater samples from borings B-14 and B-17 at concentrations of 1 ppb and 2 ppb, respectively.  Groundwater monitoring was conducted at the site quarterly in 1982; however, no further monitoring occurred between 1983 and 1992.  Groundwater monitoring then restarted and occurred semi-annually from 1993 to the present.  Concentrations up to 2,700 ppb TPHg and 7 ppb benzene were documented in the most recent groundwater monitoring event in September 2012.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This fuel leak case addresses five underground storage tanks (USTs) that were located beneath the sidewalk in front of a commercial building at 632-638 2nd Street, Oakland, CA.  Surrounding land use is commercial and industrial.      The commercial building at 632-638 2nd Street was leased by PG&amp;E in the 1950s.  After PG&amp;E vacated the property, the building appears to have been used by a door manufacturer in the 1960s.  The building was later used as a hardware storage warehouse.  Small businesses currently occupy the building spaces.    On September 13, 1996, three soil borings were advanced in the area of the suspected USTs to determine if subsurface soils were impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons.  During the drilling of SB-1, stained and odorous soils were encountered to a depth of 4.5 feet bgs.  At 5 feet bgs, the sampler pierced an unknown object which was suspected to be one of the USTs and dropped into a void under its own weight.  Upon retrieval, the sampler was coated with a liquid that had a petroleum odor.  Soil boring SB-3, which was advanced to a depth of two feet at a location several feet from SB-1, encountered gray-stained soil with a petroleum odor.  A fingerprint analysis of the soil sample from SB-3 indicated that the petroleum hydrocarbons encountered in SB-3 were extremely weathered gasoline or possibly mineral spirits.    On February 2, 2007, twelve soil borings were advanced around the USTs to collect soil and groundwater samples.  Several of the borings were advanced at an angle to obtain soil samples beneath the USTs.  Analytical results from soil and groundwater samples collected in the borings indicated that leaks occurred in the tank systems for tanks I, II, and III.  The leaks were suspected to be upgradient of the tanks, most likely in the piping and dispensers.    After triple rinsing, four of the USTs (I, II, III, and IV) were closed in place by filling with concrete on May 2, 2007.  Following the cleaning and pumping of UST V on May 1, a creosote\/water mixture was observed to have partially re-filled the UTS.  Closure of UST V was delayed while the creosote level was monitored over a two week period.  The volume of creosote did not increase over the two week period from May 2 to approximately May 16, 2007.  The creosote that entered the UST following the initial cleaning and rinsing was suspected to be from an abandoned delivery line.  UST V was closed in place by filling with concrete on May 25, 2007.       In October 2008, 15 soil borings were advanced in the sidewalk near the USTs and south of the USTs in 2nd Street.  After field screening, a total of 29 soil samples were selected for laboratory analysis.  TPH as diesel was detected in 23 of the 29 soil samples at concentrations up to 22 ppm.  TPH as gasoline, BTEX, and MTBE were not detected in any of the soil samples.  TPH as diesel was detected in all 15 grab groundwater samples collected at concentrations up to 21,000 ppb.  The highest concentration of TPH as diesel was detected south of the USTs beneath 2nd Street.  Benzene was detected in 2 of the 15 grab groundwater samples at concentrations up to 9.2 ppb.     In order to assess the potential vapor intrusion to indoor air, soil vapor samples were collected at four locations along the outside wall of the building and one location adjacent to UST II on November 6, 2009.  Due to the detection of the leak compound, 2-propanol at concentrations ranging from 43 to 1,800,000 ppbv, the November 6, 2009 results were not considered reliable and a second sampling event took place on November 19, 2009.  No chemicals of concern were detected in the five soil vapor samples collected on November 19, 2009.  Based on the November 19, 2009 sampling results, vapor intrusion was not considered a potential threat for the site.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "On March 15, 2016, the Regional Water Board staff conditionally approved a June 30, 2015, Draft Remedial Action Plan (RAP) and a January 18, 2016, Remedial Investigation Report (RIR) and required you to submit an acceptable completion report by November 15, 2016, documenting your remedial actions to address soil, soil vapor, and groundwater impacts from the former Norge Cleaners dry cleaning facility. On November 10, 2016, we granted your November 1, 2016, time extension request to submit the Report by February 28, 2017.  On February 28, 2017, a Remediation Action Implementation Report was submitted by The Source Group, Inc., A Division of Apex Companies, LLC (Apex-SGI) on behalf of the current property owner, Richard and Lorraine Whitehurst Trust. The report presents a detailed account of soil and groundwater remedial actions completed at the Site. APEX-SGI anticipates Site redevelopment during the fourth quarter of 2017. Staff approved this report on May 26, 2017.     Report Summary - The Site has been impacted with chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) including tetrachloroethene (PCE), from dry cleaning duringoperations over the period 1965 to 1986. PCE has been detected at maximum concentrations of 191 mg\/kg in soil, 370,000 µg\/m3 in soil vapor, and 180,000 µg\/L in groundwater. The PCE plume in groundwater has historically extended off-Site a distance of approximately 225 feet towards the south-southwest. The 30-day building demolition notification period ended May 15, 2015 and demolition was completed in early June 2016. Soil excavation for remediation of VOC impacted soil is anticipated to be completed during late June and  July 2016.    The remediation implementation report documents the remedial actions performed between June 2016 and December 2016 to address soil, soil vapor and groundwater impacts onsite and offsite. The activities included:     • Demolition of 6,100 square foot commercial building;  • Excavation of 2,920 tons of contaminated soil, including approximately 677 pounds of CVOCs;  • Collection of excavation soil confirmation samples;  • Enhanced In-Situ Bioremediation (EISB) injections consisting of approximately 26,625 gallons of EOS Pro and anoxic water into the upper shallow groundwater zone via 46 temporary borings;   • Installation of groundwater remediation effectiveness monitoring well (NCW-11A); and   • Remedial effectiveness groundwater monitoring and sampling.    The report concludes that all vadose zone soil encountered with CVOCs at concentrations exceeding the cleanup goal was excavated and removed from the Site. Additionally, the EISB activities to enhance the anaerobic biodegradation process have reduced CVOC concentrations in the groundwater, and these preliminary results indicate the concentrations will continue to decrease over time.     Post-remediation monitoring for soil vapor and groundwater will occur pursuant to the approved schedule proposed in the RAP and presented in Section 6.2 of the report. The results of quarterly groundwater sampling and semi-annual soil vapor sampling will be submitted in semi-annual monitoring reports 45 days from the end of the previous quarter.       On 9\/14\/2020, Water Board approved a remedial workplan for soil vapor extraction (SVE) to reduce VOCs in soil vapor on the source property. The SVE system start up report is due 12\/21\/2020.",

This case was open in January 1990  following submittal of soil and grab-groundwater analysis iresults ndicated an unauthorized release of petroleum hydrocarbons had occured from the fueling system.       Meeting held on April 16, 2019 to discuss findings of the most recent investigation &amp; GW monitoring event, case status as it relates to the LTCP and path forward.  Topics included the General Criteria regarding FP removal to the extent practicable, methane generation as a nuisance condition or a VI issue, and Direct Contact as it relates to UST pit backfill using potential non-petroleum contaminated material.    September 1989 UPS upgraded the dispensers on the north side of the main building.  In August 1990 five exploratory borings were advanced in the northern and southern portions of the site.  The borings were converted to wells and groundwater monitoring began.  In April 1992, one 1,000-gallon bulk oil storage underground storage tank (UST) and one 1,000-gallon waste-oil UST (WOT) were removed from the northern fueling areas of the site.  TPHd concentrations of up to 360 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) were reported in soil associated with the WOT removal.  On April 2, 2009, three 10,000-gallon diesel USTs located on the south side of the building and product piping &amp; dispensers were removed and soil was partially over excavated.  TPHd concentrations were reported at up to 29,000 mg\/kg in the UST excavation and up to 850 mg\/kg in the dispenser area.  Pit water was reported to have free phase hydrocarbons and a concentration of 210,000 micrograms per liter (ug\/L) TPHd.  Monitoring well MW-1 was destroyed in conjunction with the over excavation activities.  Over excavation activities were halted when widespread impacts became evident.  Petrex, a proprietary bioremediation enhancement product, was applied to the excavation prior to backfill.  Free product has been observed in three areas- all associated with the southern fueling station.  Two areas are adjacent to the former fuel tank pit, and one area is located northeast of the tank pit area.      Free product bailing began on 2\/12\/2002 and continued until 6\/14\/2011 as needed, until a product skimmer was installed.  the skimmers were operated through 2015.  A total of approximately 260 gallons of free product have been removed from the site.   As of 2018, measureable free product continues to be observed at the site with on-going GW monitoring.  The free plume may have been delineated as a result of the addition of wells to the network in 2018.   Three soil vapor wells were also installed.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The property, located the corner of 23rd Avenue and 27th Street in Oakland, formerly housed a Texaco-branded gasoline service station from at least 1928 to 1964 and is currently occupied by a convenience store (Ed’s Liquor). The property is in a residential area.    The former gasoline service station included dispenser islands in the southwestern corner of the property, a station kiosk in the northeastern corner of the property and an auto repair shop in the eastern portion of the property. The service station was demolished in 1964 and the current building on the property was constructed in 1968. Although the 1968 building construction plans refer to the intended removal of the gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs), the location, number, and capacity of the former USTs is unknown.   Environmental investigation activities related to the former presence of the service station began in 2010, which have included installation of monitoring wells; sampling and analysis of groundwater, soil, and soil vapor to determine the magnitude and extent of remaining petroleum hydrocarbons in the subsurface; and utility surveys to determine the potential locations of piping and USTs. The environmental investigations to date indicate petroleum-related compounds remain in soil and groundwater on and in the vicinity of the property.     In February and March 2021, additional work was performed which included drilling, collection and laboratory testing of soil, soil vapor and groundwater samples, and survey work to locate possible tanks or piping remaining beneath the ground.    Previous Cleanup Action: Metal piping remaining in a portion of the site was removed in November 2010 and disposed offsite.    Additional Cleanup Action: Additional cleanup is required to address the residual petroleum-related compounds. The goal of the most recent sampling conducted in February 2021 was to fill data gaps and included collection and laboratory testing of soil and groundwater samples from both onsite and offsite locations. This new information will help Alameda County Department of Environmental Health and Chevron Environmental Management Company evaluate potential cleanup options for the property.",

Pursuant to Prohibition A.2 of that Order, stormwater runoff which has been in contact with process wastes and raw materials, is prohibited from being discharged to Waters of the State. Cleanup and Abatement Orders were issued in response to discharges to Elmhurst Creek, possiby via on-site sotrm drains, contrary to prohibitions outlined in the permit. During an April 14, 1995 site inspection and again on May 3, 1995, Board staff observed a black powdery waste material throughout the site on the paved areas and outside of the facility. The black and gritty material was grab sampled, analyzed and determined to consist of lead, zinc, copper, chromium, and arsenic at concentrations that exceed the allowable levels. Deposits of the waste material were observed in Elmhurst Creek at the waste-water outfalll W0001, being similar to the material found on the paved areas of the discharger's facility.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is a former gasoline service station.  Adjacent property use is residential.      In 1989, a 1\/2-inch hole was found beneath the eastern pump island in the unleaded gasoline supply line.  An on-site soil gas survey indicated that contamination was present beneath the pump islands and the sewer line on the western edge of the property.  Borings and monitoring wells were advanced at the site in December 1989.  The area northeast of the sewer access was also excavated in December 1989.  Gasoline appeared to be seeping from the backfill around the sewer line.    The USTs and piping were removed on June 23, 1994.  Approximately 1,700 cubic yards of contaminated soil was removed from the site during over excavation of the UST and dispenser areas.    In August 1999, an interceptor trench was installed in Brighton Avenue to remove contaminated groundwater.  Groundwater has been periodically removed from the receptor trench as well as an on-site well.  A total of about 1.8 million gallons of groundwater has been extracted and treated using carbon units and then discharge to the sanitary sewer.      Source area treatment  has been done via excavation of approximately 1,850 cubic yards of soil as well as water from an extraction well.     Ten soil gas samples collected during 2012 &amp; 2013 from both on and off-site do not show concentrations of concern in any of the samples.

The Site currently consists of a 0.64-acre lot with one commercial building recently used as a label manufacturing and printing facility.    Remedial actions implemented at the Site include the removal of two sumps (north and south) in the eastern portion of the building and associated underground piping, a dynamometer pit, and 12 hydraulic hoists with 9 associated oil reservoirs, and source soil excavations at the eastern area and southern sump and groundwater injections of biogeochemical reagents to degrade trichloroethene (TCE) and other chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A subslab ventilation system was installed at the Site to facilitate mitigation of vapor intrusion risk for future occupants. The SSV currently operates by passive venting, but can be converted to active or subslab depressurization.    An offsite investigation is planned to delineate the extent of groundwater and soil gas contamination.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site fails the LTCP Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater as post remediation groundwater verification sampling of shallow groundwater beneath and in the vicinity of the site is incomplete. TPHd contamination has been detected in offsite soil samples collected at 8 to 10 feet below ground surface in borings located within King Street at concentrations indicative of free product migration in accordance with the SWRCB's Technical Justification for Vapor Intrusion Media-Specific Criteria document (350 mg\/kg in E-45 @ 10 feet bgs, 1800 mg\/kg in E-46 at 10 feet bgs, and 560 mg\/kg in E-49 at 8.5 feet bgs). These borings are located near the source area and along the approximate alignments of the storm drain and sanitary sewer) in King Street. Soil and shallow groundwater impacts remain uncharacterized to the west (or downgradient) of these borings. The storm sewer along King Street flow north and intersects a second storm sewer that travels west to the Brooklyn Basin. Therefore, potential impacts to surface water due to free product migration along preferential pathways remains undefined. ACEH directive letter dated 6\/22\/2013 requested a work plan with a submittal date of 8\/22\/2013.     Four USTs were removed in 1989.  In December 1990, one additional UST was removed followed by the removal of the last UST in January 1991.  Subsurface investigations, including monitoring well installations occurred between December 1991 through March 2007.  In 2010 excavation activities were conducted to remove source area soil to a depth of approximately 11 feet bgs, however significant TPHd contamination remains in off-site soil. The existing groundwater monitoring well network at the site consists of four on-site groundwater monitoring wells (designated as MW-101, MW-102, MW-103, and MW-104) installed in 2009 to depths of 25 to 28 feet bgs. Wells MW-1 and MW-102 are located downgradient of the source area the source areas excavated in 2010 at the western edge of the site and are screened form 18 to 28 feet bgs. Wells MW-103 and MW-104 are located upgradient of the excavated source areas and are screened form 10 to 25 feet bgs.     A review of recent groundwater sample analytical results and groundwater flow data from the current groundwater monitoring wells indicates the extent of dissolved phase hydrocarbons in the deeper water-bearing unit appears adequately characterized at this time. However, since the zone of contamination that was remediated in 2010 was shallow, ACEH remains concerned that a shallow water-bearing unit continues to be unmonitored as the depths of the existing site wells may no intersect this first water bearing zone, but rather a second deeper water bearing zone. Based on residual soil and groundwater analytical data, it appears appropriate to install shallow monitoring wells to verify the effectiveness of the source removal activities and delineate off-site soil and groundwater impacts to the west of the site.",

Petroleum hydrocarbons and fuel oxygenates were not detected at concentrations above reporting limits in four soil samples collected from the soil borings.  With the exception of tert butyl alcohol (TBA), petroleum hydrocarbons and fuel oxygenates were not detected at concentrations above reporting limits in groundwater samples samples collected from the three soil borings.  TBA was detected in one of three groundwater samples at a concentration of 14 micrograms per liter.    The site was evaluated for case closure under the State Water Resources Control Board Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This site is a part of a large redevelopment project (EBMUD Adeline Maintenance Center (AMC) constructed in three phases over a two year period beginning in 1996) comprising four city blocks (designated as Blocks I through IV). Prior to redevelopment, historical site activities included a former gasoline and service station- referenced as area of concern (AOC) 1; a former auto shop (AOC-2); a former machine shop and waste oil tank (AOC-3), a former service center (AOC-4), and a former welding shop (AOC-5) since at least the 1930's.  This case was opened in February 1988 following the June 1987 removal of three USTs having capacities of 10,000 gallons, 500 gallons and 20 gallons, with laboratory analysis performed on soil samples collected following the removals reporting up to 460 mg\/kg total volatile petroleum hydrocarbons (TVPH) and up to 15 mg\/kg benzene, indicating a release of petroleum hydrocarbons had occurred.     In November 1994, six USTs were removed from the site on portions of Block II, in the vicinity of the former service station. Approximately 1,390 tons of hydrocarbon impacted soil was excavated and disposed of off-site. Elevated concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as gasoline (g), TPH as diesel, total oil and grease (TOG), and benzene were detected in soil samples at concentrations of 2,800 mg\/kg, 440 mg\/kg, 900 mg\/kg, and 16 mg\/kg, respectively.     Additional site assessment activities were conducted in 1995 and 1996 within the Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 areas to evaluate the subsurface conditions in support of the site demolition and construction of the new AMC. Based on site data, a Materials Management Plan (MMP) was prepared to coordinate remediation of impacted soil with the planned AMC construction activities.    Phase 1 source removal activities were conducted in March 1996 and included soil excavation on parcels located within Block 4 in conjunction with demolition of existing site structures and construction of the new fleet maintenance building. Approximately 1,900 cubic yards (3,265 tons) of petroleum hydrocarbon and metal impacted soil was excavated in accordance with the ACEH approved Materials Management Plan dated January 19, 1996 and  Addendum No. 1 to the MMP dated January 26, 1996. Excavation activities were terminated upon reaching the objective threshold criteria identified in the MMP. Petroleum impacted excavation water was treated on-site and discharged to the sanitary sewer. Following completion of the Phase 1 activities, ACDEH determined that corrective action for the petroleum hydrocarbon and metal contamination at Block 4 had been completed (letter dated June 7, 1996).    Additional source removal and groundwater extraction was conducted in June 1997 in conjunction with Phase 2 construction activities within parcels located on Block 2. Approximately 1,900 cubic yards of soil was excavated. 2,500 tons of soil were transported offsite as non-hazardous waste, and 900 tons of soil containing elevated levels of Lead (above STLC) were transported off-site as hazardous waste. An undisclosed quantity of water seeping into the excavation was treated in by an on-site carbon filter system and discharged to the sanitary sewer.    An additional subsurface investigation was conducted in 2009 to further characterize the extent of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater at three areas of concern (AOCs) -  AOC-1 (former gas station), AOC-2 (former auto shop), and AOC-3 (removed waste oil tank).",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. The site meets seven of eight of the LTCP General Criteria, the LTCP Media Specific for Groundwater, Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air, and Direct Contact and Outdoor Air Exposure.    However, ACDEH determined that the site does not meet the General Criteria f, Secondary Source Removal based on the following data: the 1953 Tidewater Oil Company Architectural Plan indicated the presence of four-1,000 gallons USTs, a 110-gallon waste oil UST, a hydraulic lift, a grease trap with drainage to the sewer, and a waste oil drain.  In January 2007, without Oakland Fire Department permitting, documentation, or oversight, a 1,000-gallon UST, a 300-gallon UST, and a hydraulic lift were removed by an unknown contractor. Consequently, at least three 1,000-gallon USTs, a grease trap, and a waste oil drain are unaccounted for. The April 11, 2014 Geophysical Survey concluded that two high strength rectangular surface projection conductive anomalies may indicate the presence of metal mass USTs or other dense conductive debris remains beneath the site. Three smaller conductive anomalies may be associated with the former hoists or remaining buried building demo material.    Due to residual contamination and infrastructure remaining in the subsurface at the site associated with historic land use as a gasoline service station, institutional controls have been established by ACDEH for the property located at 7600 MacArthur Boulevard, in Oakland (the “Property”). A Covenant and Environmental Restriction on Property (“Land Use Covenant”), dated June 19, 2019 was recorded for the Property on June 19, 2019, in the Official Records of Alameda County, California as Document No. 2019116376 and sets forth provisions, covenants, conditions and restrictions on development, use, and conveyance of the Property. All uses and development of the Property shall be consistent with any applicable site documents, including the Soil and Groundwater Management Plan, dated December 11, 2018, prepared by GHD with reference to the Tidewater Oil Company’s 1953 Architectural Plan which serves as a guide to the location of historic infrastructure.    If a change in land use other than as a vacant lot with no structures or buildings, or if any site redevelopment is planned, ACDEH must be notified as required by the LUC and Government Code Section 65850.2.2.",

During July 1998, Harding-Lawson Associates (HLA) conducted a geophysical survey to determine if Tank 5 had been removed. HLA encountered “potentially buried metal” in the area. The results of the geophysical survey are provided in the “Geophysical Survey for Properties at North Field, Metropolitan Oakland International Airport, Oakland, California,\" prepared by HLA and dated December 16, 1998. The Port of Oakland conducted pot-holing at that location in an attempt to determine if Tank 5 was still present, but found only the concrete footings (Port of Oakland 2008). The tank has apparently been removed, but no formal documentation is filed with the Port of Oakland. �As stated in the February 12, 2016 NDAI Request letter, this AOC was determined to contain sufficient information to require no further action.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Currently the property is owned by Kaiser Permanente and is occupied by a newly constructed Medical Office Building (MOB).  As a Chevron service station, two documented generations of USTs and dispensers were present; both generations of USTs were previously located in the NW portion of the site.  It is not known when the first generation USTs were installed; however, documented releases date to 1977.  The second generation replaced first generation USTs in 1988; free-phase was present on groundwater.  Wells EA-1 and EA-2 were installed in 1988.  Wells A to F and B-1 to B-4 were installed in 1992, wells B-5 to B-7 are reported to have been installed in 1979 (?).  The majority of the site has now been excavated to between 15 and 20 feet bgs to either allow construction of the MOB, or to remove soil with elevated hydrocarbon impacts.  All onsite wells were destroyed prior to this work.  Onsite, prior to destruction, one to two of the most downgradient wells consistently contained free-phase, while offsite wells across the street were, and remain ND.  Due to the depth of utilities in the vicinity preferential pathways appear to be involved.  Downgradient delineation to the south has not been conducted; a work plan is pending.  Additionally a storm drain, occupying a former stream channel, is located to the immediately north of the site and has a history of reported discharges further downstream.  This potential preferential pathway has not been fully explored to date; a work plan addendum is pending on this work.  Conversely upgradient release sites in the immediate vicinity may have also contributed to the historic storm drain discharges; this remains unresolved.  The pending work plan addendum will also cover the installation of new post-soil remediation wells.    Not all historic documents for the fuel leak case may be available on GeoTracker.  A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is an active 76-branded service station, which includes a single-story building containing a convenience store and two product dispenser islands with individual canopies. An automotive service area and two hydraulic hoists were formerly located adjacent to the convenience store. Two 15,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tanks are located in the southern corner of the site. The surrounding area includes mixed commercial and residential development. Adjacent to the site is the Oakland Veterinary Hospital (OVH) to the northwest, a residential parcel to the north, and a single-family residence to the northeast. The site is bordered by MacArthur Boulevard to the southwest with a vacant lot on the opposite side of the street, and High Street to the southeast with a commercial business plaza on the opposite side of the street. A vacant lot is south of the site across the intersection of MacArthur Boulevard and High Street.    An unauthorized release was reported in March 1999 following the removal of three USTs (two gasoline tanks and one waste oil tank) and approximately 1,400 cubic yards of impacted soil in April and August 1998. Groundwater extraction between July 2001 and December 2004 removed approximately 476,000 gallons of contaminated groundwater from three wells (TP-1, MW-1, and MW-7). Active remediation has not been conducted at the Site since November 2020. Since 1999, twenty-five groundwater monitoring wells have been installed and regularly monitored, and seventeen wells have been abandoned or destroyed. Free product has historically been observed in three Site wells with a maximum thickness of 0.30 feet in MW-12 (July 2019). An absorbent sock was installed on monitoring well PZ-1 in July 2019, but no free product has been recovered to date. Free product is currently observed in one Site well (PZ-1) with a thickness of 0.07 feet. According to groundwater data, water quality objectives (WQOs) have not been achieved.     From October through November 2020, excavation at several trenches to 10 feet below ground surface (bgs) removed approximately 650 cubic yards of impacted soil. The excavation removed approximately 600 cubic yards of petroleum hydrocarbon-impacted soil from an area of 1,250 square feet to approximately 10 to 12 feet below ground surface (bgs) northwest of the existing station building and uncovered a previously unknown underground storage tank (UST) of approximately 8 feet in diameter by 20 feet long beneath the northwest corner of the station building. The trenches were backfilled with gypsum, rock, and structural fill.  Following advancement and backfill of the excavations, a total of 41 gypsum permeable filled borings were installed to 20 feet below ground surface to promote degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater within the excavation footprint where expansion of the existing fuel service station building is planned.",

The currently existing warehouse building at the subject site was constructed by 1957. Sanborn maps show the building occupied by a “plastic fabricator” with a storefront along East 12th Street and the rest of the structure used for manufacturing and warehouse space.  From approximately 1964 to 1978, Tap Plastics Inc., a manufacturer of plastic styrene paste and polystyrene containers, occupied most of the on-site warehouse.

To redevelop the Site, environmental investigations are required to evaluate impacts to the subsurface from historic land use and develop corrective actions to reduce potential risk to construction workers, the surrounding community, and occupants of the new development.  Subsurface investigations have been conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to various residential, commercial, and industrial configurations including wood\/coal storage and burning operations, a fire station, pharmaceutical manufacturing, shoe polish manufacturing and several urban farming operations.  Results of these subsurface investigations has identified chemicals of concern (COCs) in environmental media (soil, soil vapor, and groundwater).  To address this contamination prior to development, proposed corrective actions include the excavation of soil to facilitate the construction of foundation elements, utility corridors, and landscaping areas and remove historically contaminated soil; consolidation of impacted soil on-site beneath future buildings\/hardscape or importation of clean fill layer, or transportation of impacted soil to a licensed, off-Site disposal at a license facility; backfill of utility corridors with clean imported fill material, and installation of a sub-slab vapor barrier and venting system beneath the planned building to prevent VOCs from entering indoor air.  Proposed redevelopment of the Site includes a five-story at-grade mixed-use building that will consist of 79 affordable residential units, areas designated for commercial use, and parking on the ground floor. The northern property boundary is planned for landscape areas and urban farming.  Redevelopment will include the demolishment of the existing modular structures and excavation of soil to approximately three to eight feet below ground surface (bgs) for construction of the building foundation, utility trenching, and other subsurface features (i.e. elevators pits).      The subject site is located on the northern side of 7th Street, between Campbell Street and Willow Street in the Prescott neighborhood of West Oakland and consists of six parcels (cumulatively the “Site”) which totals approximately 0.66 acres. All six parcels are currently owned by the City of Oakland.  Historic land use on these parcels included but were not limited to various residential, commercial, and industrial configurations including wood\/coal storage and burning operations, a fire station, pharmaceutical manufacturing, shoe polish manufacturing and several urban farming operations. A summary of the site setting and historical land use for each parcel is provided in the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (Phase I ESA), dated January 2019, and prepared on behalf of McCormack Baron Salazar by SCA Environmental, Inc (SCA).  An electronic copy of the Phase I ESA can be referenced on the State Water Board’s GeoTracker website.    Proposed redevelopment includes a five-story at-grade structure with a building footprint of approximately 27,300 square feet. The mixed-use building will consist of 79 affordable residential units, areas designated for commercial use, and parking on the ground floor. The northern property boundary is planned for landscape areas and urban farming.  Redevelopment will include the demolishment of the existing modular structures and excavation of soil to approximately three to eight feet below ground surface (bgs) for construction of the building foundation, utility trenching, and other subsurface features (i.e. elevators pits).    Environmental investigations were conducted without ACDEH oversight in June 2020 to evaluate subsurface soil, groundwater, and soil vapor conditions.  Eight exploratory borings (EB-1 through EB-2) where advanced up to a depth of 15 feet bgs. Subsurface soils observed during this investigation consisted of 5 to 7 feet fill material across the entire site underlaid predominately by silty and clayey sands, respectively.  Two permanent groundwater monitoring wells (MW-1 and MW-2) and four temporary soil vapor probes (SV-1 through SV-4) were were advanced to a total depth of 15 feet bgs and 5 feet bgs, respectively.   Monitoring wells were screened between 5 to 15 feet bgs. Stabilized groundwater encountered during this investigation was reported between 8 to 9 feet bgs. Additional environmental investigations have been conducted under ACDEH oversight in late December 2020 with investigation results still pending.    Analytical results from this investigation documented chemicals of concern (COCs) in soil, soil vapor, and groundwater samples associated with historic land-use.  Soil COCs identified during investigation activities included semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) including benzo(a)pyrene; volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including 1,2-dibromoethene and tetrachloroethene (PCE); metals including barium, chromium, lead, nickel, and zinc above laboratory detection limits.  Soil COCs above the January 2019 California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Bay Area Region residential land-use environmental screening levels (ESLs) included lead and benzo(a)pyrene.  Soil vapor COCs identified concentrations of VOCs including benzene, methylene chloride, PCE, and vinyl chloride above the January 2019 ESLs for vapor intrusion.  Groundwater COCs identified detections of SVOCs and metals above laboratory detection limits but below residential vapor intrusion ESLs.    A Draft Corrective Action Plan (Draft CAP), dated December 23, 2020 has been submitted and is currently in review with Alameda County Department of Environmental Health.  Additionally a Fact Sheet inviting the public to review and comment on the Draft CAP to address historical environmental impacts was distributed to the surrounding community on December 21, 2020.  A public meeting will be conducted on January 21, 2021 to inform the public more about Site conditions, the proposed corrective actions, discuss community protection measures, and answer questions and accept comments. Proposed corrective actions include excavation of soil to facilitate the construction of foundation elements, utility corridors, and landscaping areas and remove historically contaminated soil; consolidation of impacted soil on-site beneath future buildings\/hardscape or importation of clean fill layer, or transportation of impacted soil to a licensed, off-Site disposal facility; backfill of utility corridors with clean imported fill material, and installation of a sub-slab vapor barrier and venting system beneath the planned building to prevent VOCs from entering indoor air.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site located on the northwest corner of the intersection of 12th Street and Alice Street in Oakland, California, encompasses approximately 0.47 acres and consists of a single-story 7,500 square-foot building (vacant), a parking lot, and an outdoor space designed for future use as a day care playground. Historical operations at the Site included residential dwellings from 1889 to 1911, by different fuel stations from 1939 to early 1970's and by commercial retail including East Bay Register Exchange and Bay Spa between mid 1970's to 2010's.  A separate Leaking Underground Stroage Tank Case Number RO00003295 is open for this Site.  Work conducted under LUST Case RO0003295 was conducted in 2018.     Subsurface investigations were conducted without regulatory oversight in November 2017 and included the advancement and sampling of six sub-slab vapor probes within the onsite building (SS-1 through SS-5) and five soil borings outside of the building (B-1 through B-5) for the collection of soil and grab groundwater.  Additional subsurface investigations where conducted under regulatory oversight associated with LUST Case RO00003295 in July 2018 and included the advancement and sampling of 12 additional sub-slab vapor probes and nine five-foot-deep soil vapor probes. Results from the 2018 investigation indicated naphthalene was detected above San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board’s (RWQCB’s) Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) for residential land-use. Chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds including trichloroethene (TCE) and 1,1-dichloroethane were detected above residential ESLs in two of the 5-foot soil vapor probe samples.  ACDEH issued a directive letter on October 22, 2018  and determined media-specific criteria for vapor intrusion to indoor air is considered low risk under the State Water Resources Control Board’s Low Threat Underground Storage Tank Case Closure Policy (LTCP) for the current configuration at that time but required submittal of an additional work plan and evaluation of subsurface conditions after proposed redevelopment activities were conducted at the Site prior to occupancy.     Redevelopment activities at the Site were conducted in 2019 and consisted of shallow trench excavations associated with utility improvement and repair of electrical, telephone, water, sanitary sewer, and storm drains, and localized removal of shallow soil during landscaping work and parking lot improvements Improvement details are documented in a September 1, 2020 SGMP Implementation Letter submitted to ACDEH.     This Site Cleanup Case was opened in October 2020 to evaluate chlorinated hydrocarbon constituents of concern (COC) at this Site following completion of redevelopment improvement activities.  In October 2020, ACDEH reviewed and approved a Work Plan and Work Plan Addendum that included a scope of work to further assess vapor conditions post utility installation.  Results of this investigation are in draft format and include sampling the onsite building’s indoor air and outdoor air; and calculating a Site-specific sub-slab attenuation factor (AF) using measurements of naturally-occurring radon.",

The Phase I and Phase II reports identified potential environmental impacts at the Site from historical land use at and in the vicinity of the Site.  Multiple Phase II subsurface investigations and sampling events were conducted at the Site between 2017 and 2018 and identified soil, groundwater, soil vapor, and sub-slab vapor contamination that were related to historical uses at or in the vicinity of the Site.    In April 2020, ACDEH closed Site Cleanup Program (SCP) Case No. RO0003261 and the transitioned it to long-term management under Post-Closure Case No. RO0003383 for the commercially developed property. ACDEH’s closure determination for SCP Case No. RO0003261 was based on an analysis of risk to human health and the environment from subsurface contamination at the Site, and implementation of environmental engineering controls that lessen the risk of public exposure to chemicals of concern in the subsurface under the commercial land use scenario as a fast food restaurant at the time of case closure. Risk to receptors under different land use scenarios or Site configurations, were not considered in the closure determination of SCP Case No. RO0003261. ACDEH’s Case Closure Summary is in the case file.    ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING CONTROLS AND MONITORING SYSTEMS  Environmental engineering controls at the Site include the asphalt and concrete cap consisting of the pavement and the building foundation (the “Capped Area” or CAP) existing at the time of recordation of the Covenant and Environmental Restriction on Property (“Land Use Covenant”), dated August 13, 2019 recorded for the Property on September 18, 2019, in the Official Records of Alameda County, California as Document No. 2019186617 (the “Land Use Covenant”). A Sub-slab Vapor Monitoring Well Network consisting of two sub-slab vapor pins is installed within the Site building to monitor soil vapor conditions beneath the building foundation.     POST-CLOSURE REQUIRMENTS  ACDEH has established long-term management requirements and land use restrictions at the Site to protect the environmental engineering controls and monitoring systems at the Site, and mitigate risks and minimize exposure to construction workers, occupants, and other site users from chemicals of concern in the subsurface. The long-term Site management requirements are prescribed in the following documents:    1.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH) provided regulatory environmental oversight for the investigation and cleanup activities associated with Leaking Underground Storage Tank Case No. RO0003262 from December 2017 to October 2019 subsequent to a property transfer.  Subsurface investigations were conducted to evaluate historical operations at the Site including but not limited to residential dwellings and various commercial configurations such as automobile service and repair operations with associated former underground storage tanks.      This site is eligible for closure based on the low risk from petroleum constituents under the Low Threat Closure Policy.     The site is located at 401 Jackson Street at the northwest corner of Jackson Street and 4th Street.  The site consists of one parcel and is surrounded by mixed-commercial and residential properties.  Historically the property consisted of a two-story structure and operated as residential dwellings between the 1880's and 1900's. In the 1940's the site was redeveloped as the currently developed industrial building consisting of a single story commercial warehouse.  Operations between 1940's and 1990's included food processing and packing, wholesale poultry sales, and slaughterhouse.  Between the 1990's and 2010's the site primarily operated as a meat processing and packing facility.  Currently the property is pending a sales transaction.    Information collected in the Phase I investigation indicated one underground storage tank (UST) was located beneath the southwestern corner of the warehouse.  Based on interviews conducted during the Phase I, the UST was reportedly used for gasoline and installed in 1960's and abandoned inplace and filled with concrete in 1980's.  No evidence of a release at the site was identified during record review.      Subsurface investigations were performed at the site during July, August, and November 2017 and included the collection of soil, sub-slab vapor, soil gas, and groundwater samples and completion of two geophysical surveys.  Concentrations of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon as motor oil (TPH-mo) in soil were reported up to 12 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg).  Groundwater samples reported Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon as gasoline (TPH-g), benzene, and methyl tert butyl ether (MTBE) at concentrations of 3,800, 21, and 16 micrograms per liter (ug\/l) respectively.  Additionally, Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon as diesel (TPH-d) and TPH-mo in groundwater were reported up to 3,400 and 45,000 ug\/l, respectively, in an area located outside the southeast corner of the building which was not consistent with the noted former gasoline UST reported and consistent of a home heating oil tank. Concentrations reported in temporary sub-slab soil vapor probes installed beneath the foundation in the vicinity of the former gasoline UST indicated a low threat from petroleum hydrocarbons and associated constituents.  Additionally, results of the geophysical surveys did not identify the presence of a historical heating oil tank or gasoline UST.    Subsequent investigation activities were conducted in first quarter 2018 to evaluate secondary source below the suspected heating oil tank pit, delineate the petroleum hydrocarbon groundwater plume, and evaluate vapor intrusion in sub-slab soil gas across the building footprint.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently occupied by a two-story commercial building built in 1969 which occupies the entire parcel. The former gasoline service station was demolished and cleared in 1966, but no records were on file with the Oakland Building Department, Alameda County Environmental Health Services Department or Oakland Fire Department regarding the number of USTs, removal of the USTs, and\/or confirmation sampling of the USTs. In July 2011, three soil borings were advanced around the site building.  Concentrations up to, 59,000 parts per billion (ppb) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) and 200,000 ppb Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd) were documented in grab groundwater samples. These concentrations indicate an unauthorized release has occurred from the UST(s) at the site and this Leaking Underground Fuel Tank (LUFT) case was opened to investigate the release.  Environmental investigations have occurred from 2011 through 2017 and have included installation of four soil vapor points and the collection of soil, groundwater and soil gas samples.     This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum-related contaminants. ACDEH has determined that the site meets the LTCP General Criteria and Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater and Vapor Intrusion but not Media Specific Criteria for Direct Contact and Outdoor Air. Although PAHs were not detected at\/above the laboratory detection levels used by the laboratory in soil samples taken within the 0 to 5 foot depth interval in the building footprint, the laboratory detection levels used by the laboratory exceeded the Table 1 concentrations for residential and commercial\/industrial worker exposure current maximum concentrations of PAHs as benzo(a)pyrene toxicity equivalent (BaPe).  ACDEH has determined that there is low potential for direct contact exposure because of the current land use as a commercial building resulting in a low potential for direct contact exposure to shallow soil beneath the building footprint. Therefore, the site poses a low risk to human health and safety and the environment.

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site designated with Assessor’s Parcel Numbers 049-0952-004, 049-0952-006, and 049-0952-007, and street address 3800 San Pablo Avenue, is located on the southeast corner of the intersection of 39th Street and Adeline Street in a commercial and residential area of Emeryville, California. The Site is bounded by 39th Street to the north, residences to the east, West MacArthur Boulevard to the south, and Adeline Street and San Pablo Avenue to the west. The Site is currently undergoing redevelopment as The Intersection. The Site development includes two separate structures: (1) A new residential structure on the east half of the Site that includes two stories of concrete podium parking and five stories of multitenant residential units; and (2) Redevelopment of the existing building structure on the west half of the Site as commercial units. Evaluation of risk to off-site receptors from the HVOC vapor plume is still ongoing.    This case was opened to manage the risk of vapor intrusion due to elevated methane in the southern portion of the western building, and halogenated volatile organic compounds (HVOC) including PCE and TCE in subslab vapor at levels potentially of concern. The approximately 1.1-acre Site was most recently in use for storage and minor business uses and was once part of a truck showroom and repair facility. Results of vapor sampling show an halogenated volatile organic compound (HVOC) vapor plume beneath the Site building slab. Results of soil and groundwater sampling have not identified an onsite HVOC source and did not indicate an offsite HVOC source.     Due to sub-slab vapor PCE and TCE concentrations beneath the Site slab being above the January 2019 San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) for both commercial and residential land use, vapor mitigative measures are being implemented in conjunction with the site redevelopment to meet acceptable risk levels. Evaluation of risk to off-site receptors from the HVOC vapor plume is still ongoing.    For the residential development on the east side of the Site, a two-story podium parking structure has been constructed, and the vapor intrusion pathway will be addressed via two levels of actively ventilated garage and conduit seals implemented to block potential upward migration of VOC vapors via vertical utility corridors. For the commercial development, vapor mitigation measures will include the installation of a passive subslab vapor venting system and an engineered low-permeability vapor barrier coating on the concrete slab flooring throughout the commercial building area, installation of trench dams within utility corridors and sealing of dry utilities at penetrations into the building.The VIMS design is a retrofit design as the majority of the existing building structure will remain, and includes the venting system installed within trenches cut in the existing floor and a low-permeable barrier applied to the existing building floor.    Construction quality assurance and performance verification sampling will be conducted during installation of the VMS after substantial completion of the structure  to ensure the system is installed as designed and verify that design objectives have been achieved and to confirm that vapor intrusion does not represent a complete exposure pathway where engineering controls are installed. Submittal of a performance verification monitoring plan for the Residential Structure is still outstanding and must be submitted as an addendum to the VMS Plan approved by ACDEH under a separate cover.     Prior to occupancy, performance verification sampling must be completed and the results of the performance verification sampling must indicate that the vapor intrusion risk is adequately controlled. Additionally, administrative, and institutional controls will be required to be implemented including recordation of a Land Use Covenant, Risk Management Plan and Financial Assurance  for long term management of engineering controls at the site.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    Historic and current land use of the site is a single family residence in the Piedmont Hills.  On April 28, 2010 one 200-gallon underground storage tank (UST) was excavated and removed from the front yard lawn, adjacent to the sidewalk under regulatory oversight. The UST stored diesel \/ heating oil and was historically used as the primary source of heating for the residence.  At least one hole was reported to be visible in the UST.  Groundwater was not encountered in the excavation which extended to a depth of approximately 9 feet.  One confirmation soil sample was collected from the bottom of the UST excavation, and one from the excavated soil stockpile.  Soil samples were analyzed for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) as diesel, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, total xylenes, fuel oxygenates, lead scavengers, and lead.   Analytical results from the samples documented concentrations of 217 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) and 5,080 mg\/kg of TPH  as diesel from the base of the excavation and the four point composite sample from the stockpile, respectively.  None of the other analytes were detected above the laboratory reporting limits.    The soil analytical results indicate that the majority of the primary source of petroleum hydrocarbons from the UST was removed; however, vertical and lateral extent was not delineated.  The excavated soil was disposed of at an offsite permitted landfill.  Remaining source material was not excavated due to site constraints including the presence of bedrock at the base of the UST excavation, and adjacent sidewalk and street.    Site investigation activities were conducted in 2018 to evaluate the extent of subsurface impacts to soil, soil vapor and groundwater from the release.  The investigations included collection and analysis of (1) soil samples from seven soil bores (B1 to B7); (2) sub-slab vapor samples from a temporary vapor probe (SS1) installed beneath the basement floor of the residential structure; and (3) water samples from two private water supply wells located at the distances of approximately 125 feet and 325 feet downgradient of the release.    Bushy Dell Creek is approximately 450 feet downgradient to the west northwest.  The north branch of Wildwood Creek is located crossgradient to the south at a distance of approximately 1,050 feet, and Trestle Glen Creek is located upgradient to the east at a distance of approximately 2,830 feet.    A concentration of 5,080 mg\/kg diesel detected in the excavation soil stockpile sample indicate the historic presence of residual NAPL in soil. However, the analytical results of the confirmation sample collected at a depth of 9 feet bgs in the bottom of the excavated tank pit (217 mg\/kg diesel) and soil samples collected from borings B-1 through B-7 (maximum concentration of 282 mg\/kg diesel) indicate that the bulk of the residual NAPL has been removed, with the exception of residual NAPL located immediately adjacent to the former tank pit beneath the sidewalk at a depth of 2 to 4 feet bgs. Analytical results for BTEX and naphthalene in soil samples collected from borings B1 through B-7, indicate that the residual NAPL remaining in the vicinity of the former tank pit area is weathered and depleted of volatile organic compounds.     No free product was observed in the tank pit or evidence of free product observed in boring logs or indicated by dissolved phase concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater samples collected from the private wells.    This UST release case has been evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH has determined that the site meets all the LTCP General and the Media Specific Criteria for Direct Contact and Outdoor Air. The site does not meet the Media Specific Criteria for Groundwater Media and the Specific Criteria Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air. However, based on an analysis of site specific conditions a determination has been made that the residual contamination in soil at the site poses a low threat to human health and safety and to the environment under current and reasonably anticipated near-term future scenarios.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    On January 17, 2017 one approximately 300-gallon heating oil underground storage tank (UST) was removed from the subject site.  No holes were observed in the UST; however, soil discoloration and hydrocarbon odors were observed in the UST overburden soil, and in soil beneath the UST.  Concentrations of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons as diesel (TPHd) up to 14,000 milligrams per kilogram (mg\/kg) were documented by the confirmation sample in soil at the base of the former underground storage tank (UST), whereas concentrations of TPHd up to 9,800 mg\/kg and of naphthalene up to 360 mg\/kg were documented in the stockpile generated by the removal of the former UST.  Excess soil from the removal, weighing 1.43 tons, was disposed of offsite at the Keller Canyon Landfill.  No additional excavation is reported.  These data indicate that an unauthorized release has occurred at the site.    Since 2017 two site investigations have been conducted, and included soil and soil vapor.  Groundwater was not encountered beneath the site, thus it is a soils only case.  Analytical data indicate that concentrations indicative of NAPL in soil are present at and downhill of the release and based on the presence of petroleum staining in cracks in the basement concrete slab adjacent to the foundation, remains mobile.  The NAPL may also be utilizing a relative shallow sanitary sewer later preferential pathway to migrate (2 - 3 feet from concrete staining).  While the site appears to meet the Low Threat Closure Policy, the case has been kept open due to the migrating NAPL. A Corrective Action Plan has been approved as Interim Remediation due to the presence of the petroleum staining in interior space, and due to the close proximity of the preferential pathway.    Remedial excavation was performed from September 30 to October 23, 2019. The purpose of the remedial actions was to remove to the extent possible, the residual fuel oil contaminated soil and weathered bedrock underlying the historic home heating system.  The basement excavation RSE1 reached a depth of 4 to 4.5 feet below grade (fbg) and removed a total of 12.8 tons of weathered bedrock. The excavation activities for the driveway excavation RSE2 removed approximately 171 tons of contaminated weathered bedrock.    This LUST case was evaluated for closure consistent with the State Water Resource Control Board’s Low-Threat Underground Storage Tank Closure Policy (LTCP) for petroleum related contaminants. ACDEH determined that the site met all the LTCP General Criteria and Media Specific Criteria and therefore poses a low risk to human health and safety and the environment.

Concentrations up to 250 ppm TPH were documented in the excavation containing the smaller two USTs.  New 1,000-gallon USTs are reported to have been installed thereafter.  Six soil bores were installed in July 1989.  An irrigation well is reported within several hundred feet of the site in Piedmont Park, directly downgradient, as is the Piedmont Park creek, and is a potential receptor.  Soil bores BH-1 to BH-C were installed in May 2012 to resume investigation of the documented release.    TPHd concentrations in grab groundwater samples have suggested indirect evidence of free product in accordance with the SWRCB's Technical Justification document for Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air. The downgradient extent of the plume has not been defined, however; contamination appears to utilize a preferential pathway (City Hall french drain) which has impacted the french drain discharge.  The french drain previously discharged to the city street as a non-point source.  Remedial actions in 2018 consisted of connecting the discharge for the french drain to sanitary sewer. On July 2, 2020, following a meeting with the City of Piedmont, ACDEH received documentation from the City of Piedmont that the discharge of the groundwater to the sewer lateral was complete and that discharge had been routed to the sewer since 2015.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The site is currently an operating gasoline service station located in a mixed commercial and residential area of Oakland, California.  The triangular-shaped site is located at the former confluence of Pleasant Valley Creek and Bushy Dell Creek.  Both creeks are currently channeled in underground culverts beneath Grand Avenue (former Pleasant Valley Creek) and Wildwood Avenue (former Bushy Dell Creek).  Drainage flows south through the culverts to discharge to Lake Merritt approximately 4,000 feet to the south.      Following the removal and replacement of underground storage tanks (USTs) in August 1984, four soil borings (E-1 through E-4) were advanced at the site on August 6, 2008.  Petroleum hydrocarbons were observed at approximately 5 feet bgs in thee of the borings completed within the tank backfill.      In June 1987, a 550-gallon waste oil tank was replaced.  Soil samples collected during the waste oil tank removal did not contain petroleum hydrocarbons or volatile organic compounds at concentrations above reporting limits.    In August 1988, five soil borings (B-1 through B-5) were advanced to 15.5 feet bgs adjacent to the USTs.  Up to 6,500 ppm of total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) was detected in boring B-3 and up to 750 ppm of TPHg was detected in B-4.      In July 1989, six soil borings were advanced (BH-D through BH-I) and three groundwater monitoring wells were installed (MW-1 through MW-3).  Up to 710 ppm of TPHg was detected in soil samples collected from four of the borings.  Petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in the initial groundwater samples collected from wells MW-2 and MW-3.       In January 1990, three soil borings (BH-J through BH-L) were advanced and two groundwater monitoring wells were installed (MW-4 and MW-5).  Petroleum hydrocarbons were not detected in soil samples collected from the three soil borings.       On June 16, 1995, monitoring well MW-4, which was a flowing artesian well installed in a lower water-bearing zone, was decommissioned.      The dispensers and piping were upgraded in March 1998.  Petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in the soil sample collected beneath the northwestern dispenser at concentrations of 1,600 TPHg and 6.3 ppm benzene (D-2 at 2 feet bgs).     The dispensers and piping were again upgraded in April 2005.  Soil samples collected beneath the dispensers contained up to 610 ppm of TPHg and 890 ppm of TPHd.  One 550-gallon waste oil tank was removed on May 9, 2007.    Quarterly groundwater monitoring has been conducted at the site since July 1989.  During the third quarter 2009 groundwater sampling event, groundwater from MW-3 contained 1,800 ppb TPHg, 21 ppb benzene, 17 ppb MTBE, and 53 ppb TBA. Groundwater samples were analyzed for halogenated VOCs from May 1998 through July 2001. Halogenated VOCs were detected in groundwater from off-site wells MW-4 and MW-5, which are located on the opposite side of Grand Avenue from the site, but were not detected in the on-site monitoring wells.  The halogenated VOCs are likely from an off-site source.",

     "SITE_HISTORY": "The Site is located in a residential area of Piedmont and consists of one parcel (Assessor Parcel Number 51-4728-17) historically used as residential. Based on reporting, an existing home was demolished approximately 100 years ago due to fire damage and remnants of the destroyed home were buried approximately 2 feet below ground surface and the current residence was subsequently constructed. During recent home upgrade activities (consisting of installation of a home extension to the north of the existing residence, addition of landscaping, patio, and concrete retaining walls) an underground storage tank (UST) was uncovered at approximately 4 feet below ground surface. In September 2018 UST removal activities were conducted. The fill port was located on the top of the tank and associated UST infrastructure (piping, etc.) were not observed during UST excavation. The UST was reported to be in poor condition with visible holes and soil discoloration and hydrocarbon odors were observed in the UST excavation. Based on the size of the tank, an Alameda County Department of Environmental Health Certified Unified Program Agency representative was not present during UST removal or sampling activities. Approximately 275-gallons of residual liquid was removed from the UST by vacuum truck. Residual liquids inside the UST were analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as diesel (TPH-d) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Following UST removal, soil samples were collected including two discrete samples from beneath the south end of the UST and two discrete samples from beneath the north end of the UST at approximately 6 and 8 feet below ground surface. Soil samples were analyzed for TPH-d, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Results indicated TPH-d was detected at 6 feet and 8 feet bgs on both ends of the former UST. Over-excavation activities were conducted in October 2018 on the east and west sidewalls at 8 feet below ground surface and the excavation bottom at 10 feet below ground surface and one confirmation sample was collected from each over-excavation area; TPH-d was detected in each of the samples. Additional over-excavation activities were conducted on the east and north sidewalls at 9 feet bgs and one confirmation sample was collected from each over-excavation area. TPH-d was detected as low concentrations at SS-ES-9 at 10 milligrams per kilogram. A total of approximately 30.8 tons of petroleum impacted soil were removed from the excavation and over-excavation area. Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities. Soil was excavated to allow for footings and the construction of the below grade garage area to approximately 16 feet in depth. To install retaining walls, construct the north patio and landscaped areas, and remove buried debris, approximately 3-4 feet in depth of soil was excavated and removed from these areas as well. The garage\/basement was constructed with an 18-inch concrete mat slab and 12-inch reinforced concrete exterior walls with waterproofing and drainage features; benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes were not detected in soil samples collected adjacent to the building. The patio that covers the former over-excavation area consists of a grouted stone layer over a six-inch thick concrete slab with rebar and the patio area is surrounded by retaining walls constructed with 18-inch deep double concrete-filled CME with rebar and stucco finish.",

A complete case file for this site is located on the Alameda County Environmental Health website at: http:\/\/ehgis.acgov.org\/dehpublic\/dehpublic.jsp.    The site is located within a mixed residential \/commercial area in Piedmont.  The site consists of a 5,000 square foot building located on approximately 0.5 acre parcel.  PG&amp;E originally built the building, Substation E in 1926.  The building stored equipment  which contained PCBs in insulation oil, lead in lead-based paint, and asbestos.  Soil surrounding the building appears to have been contaminated by lead based paint, which weathered and came of the building over time, and may also have been present in the imported soil.  The exterior walls of the building have since been scraped, cleaned, and blasted.    On 10\/19\/1999 nine surface soil samples (SESP-1 through SESP-9) were collected at the site. SESP-1 through SESP-8 were located on the outside of the building while SESP-9 was located in a sump within the building.  The exterior samples were collected from unpaved surface soils and analyzed for lead, PCBs, TPH as motor oil, mineral oil, and diesel.  Up to 1,600 mg\/kg lead, 0.14 ppm PCB, 69 ppm TPHd and 67 ppm TPHmo was detected in the samples.     On 11\/23\/1999, four borings (B1 through B4) were advanced at the site. Soil samples were collected from each boring from surface to 30 inches in depth and analyzed for lead.  The results indicated that lead concentrations decreased significantly with depth, with the highest lead concentration being 46 ppm in the deepest samples.    Between January and March 2001, soils surrounding the exterior of the building were excavated ranging in depth from 6-24 inches. The highest residual lead concentration detected in the twelve post-excavation samples (A-H) was 178 ppm.  Approximately 582 cubic yards of soil was excavated and disposed of offsite.    On June 28, 2004, four soil samples were taken from areas where lead analytical data was lacking. Two samples were taken from each location, one from a depth of 6 - 9 inches and the other from a depth of 12 - 15 inches.  The results indicated that an eastern strip of the property had lead concentrations exceeding the residential ESL of 200 ppm (shallow soils where groundwater is a potential drinking water source) and that the southwest corner of the site was below this ESL.    On January 11, 2005, the eastern section of the site was excavated to a depth of approximately 2 feet.  On January 18, 2005 after the soils were deemed dry enough after recent rains, four post-excavation confirmation samples (EXC-Conf1 through EXC-Conf4) were collected for lead analysis.  These samples ranged from 9.1 to 36 ppm.  The pH of the soil ranged from 5.48 to 6.93. Approximately 56 cy of soil was excavated and disposed of off-site.    Soil remediation activities were conducted on April 2, 2007 to remove residual petroleum hydrocarbons and includes excavation of seven cubic yards of soil from location T3.  The soils were excavated by hand in an area approximately 20 feet long, 2.5 feet wide, and 4 feet deep.  TPHmo was detected at a concentration of 61 mg\/kg in a confirmation sample collected from the base of the trench.  The excavation was backfilled with soil imported soil.    On July 22, 2014 a work plan for post-remediation confirmation sampling was submitted and, on October 1, 2014 a modified work plan approval letter was issued by ACEH.  Between August 18 and October 3, 2014 remaining lead paint on the PG&amp;E building was abated.  Between October 6, 2014, and February 5, 2015, lead contaminated soil was excavated in a series of mobilizations that are summarized in the February 23, 2015 report entitled Site Remediation and Confirmation Sampling Report .",
